**ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-orders-lifecycle-adr-outbox-publication`

## Context and Problem Statement

Eleven order events are a published contract consumed by three sibling gears. Every one of them
originates in a transition that also writes the aggregate, a version row and an audit entry inside
one database transaction.

PRD §7.1 sets the transition threshold as `p95 < 1 s` and defines it as **"durable write + event
publish"** — one budget covering both. So the question is not merely how events reach the bus, but
whether publication is part of the commit the PRD is measuring.

Publishing inside the transaction means a network call while a row lock is held. Publishing after
it means a window in which the state changed and no consumer knows. Neither is free, and the
choice determines the failure mode the whole seam inherits.

## Decision Drivers

* A transition holds the aggregate row lock, which also serialises audit-sequence allocation — anything slow inside that lock costs every concurrent caller on the same order.
* "Zero silent drops" (PRD §7.1) has to survive a broker that is unavailable at commit time.
* Per-order ordering is a contract consumers rely on; global ordering is explicitly not offered.
* A consumer must be able to de-duplicate, because any at-least-once delivery will re-deliver.
* Whatever is chosen is load-bearing for three gears and expensive to reverse once they have built against it.

## Considered Options

* **Transactional outbox with an asynchronous drain** — enqueue a row in the transition transaction, publish from a separate worker
* **Synchronous publish inside the transaction** — call the broker before commit
* **Publish after commit, in the same request** — commit, then publish, with a reconciliation sweep for the gap
* **Change data capture off the write-ahead log** — derive events from the database's own replication stream

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: **transactional outbox with an asynchronous drain**. Exactly one outbox row is
written per event-declaring committed transition, in the same transaction, and a sharded drain
publishes it afterwards. `design/01-foundation.md` §4.4 is normative.

**This decision is the reason PRD §7.1's threshold cannot hold as written**, and that is its most
important consequence rather than an incidental detail. Publication is asynchronous by
construction, so it cannot sit inside a `p95 < 1 s` commit budget; delivery carries its own
**30 s p95** budget instead (`DECISIONS.md` D-41). The combined figure is not achievable by any
implementation of this decision, which is why the divergence is routed to Product as `Q-16` rather
than asserted away. Choosing synchronous publication *would* have satisfied the PRD's wording
literally — at the cost below.

Synchronous publish is rejected because it puts a network call inside the row lock: broker latency
becomes transition latency for every caller on that order, and a broker outage becomes an
order-taking outage. It also cannot be made atomic — the commit and the publish are two systems,
so a failure between them either loses the event or commits a transition nobody can see, which is
the exact defect the outbox exists to remove.

Publish-after-commit-in-request is rejected for the same atomicity gap in a smaller window, plus
it makes every caller pay the publish latency while still needing the reconciliation sweep that
the outbox drain already is.

CDC is rejected because the event payloads are a curated contract, not a row image: `01 §4.4`
requires each event to carry a summary block sufficient for a consumer to act without fetching the
order back, and deriving that from WAL rows would put contract-shaping logic in a replication
consumer outside this gear's boundary.

### Consequences

* **A consumer sees a state change after the commit, not at it.** The delay is *targeted* at the 30 s p95 delivery budget rather than bounded by it — a p95 is a target, so an event may exceed it and enter the retry and dead-letter paths below. Anything requiring read-your-write consistency must read the order, not wait for the event.
* **Delivery is at-least-once**, so every consumer needs de-duplication. **The de-duplication key is `orders_event_outbox.event_id`**, which `01 §3.7` declares as the consumer de-duplication token, *stable across a re-drive* — stability under re-drive is precisely the property de-duplication needs, and §4.4 states the same contract ("consumer de-duplication by event ID"). `(order_id, sequence)` is a different key for a different job: it is the per-order **ordering** key, held by a UNIQUE constraint and allocated under the aggregate row lock, and the drain publishes in that order. A consumer that de-duplicated on it would be keying on ordering rather than identity.
* **Per-order ordering holds along the delivery path, and only per-order — but the guarantee is conditional.** Sharding makes it *structurally possible*: `shard_key` is `hash(order_id) % 64` with a *fixed* bucket count and the drain leases contiguous bucket ranges, so re-tuning parallelism can never split one order across two leaseholders, and the drain selects and batches in `(order_id, sequence)` order. What sharding alone does **not** give is head-of-line behaviour across a failure: when sequence `n` is retrying with backoff, or has been parked as a dead-letter row and so left the drain's partial index, sequence `n+1` for the same order is still selectable and can publish ahead of it. **`01 §3.6` has since settled it, and per-order ordering now holds across a park as well.** The drain selects on `delivered_at IS NULL` alone — so a parked dead-letter row stays visible as its stream's blocked head — and takes only the **contiguous prefix** per `order_id`, stopping at the first parked or not-yet-due row; no higher sequence for that order publishes while the parked one is undelivered, and no other order is affected (`DECISIONS.md` D-87). `01 §4.4` remains the normative home of the ordering contract, and it carries the two properties that make the rule closed rather than nominal: an operator re-drive **MUST** republish the parked row before any later event for that order and **MUST NOT** be used to skip one, and the suspension is **unbounded in duration** — a blocked order's stream halts until an operator acts. That last point is this ADR's real cost, and it is the deliberate trade: an order's stream stops rather than arriving out of order.
* **An undeliverable event becomes an operational object.** After a bounded attempt count a row is parked as an inspectable dead-letter record with an alert, and an operator re-drive endpoint exists to republish it. That endpoint has no PRD basis and is disclosed as a design-introduced surface (`Q-19`).
* **The outbox is a traffic-driven table**, so it carries a 30-day retention on delivered rows — and it is **not partitioned**, which is a correctness consequence rather than a preference. PostgreSQL requires every unique constraint on a partitioned table to include the partition key, and this table's `(order_id, sequence)` UNIQUE — the constraint per-order ordering rests on — does not. Monthly partitioning and the ordering guarantee are mutually exclusive, and ordering wins, so retention is a purge through the partial index rather than a partition drop. That purge is a **separate worker** from the per-shard drain (`01 §3.8` counts six), so it cannot lengthen a drain batch. No table in the gear is partitioned (`DECISIONS.md` D-91).
* **The audit trail and the event stream can disagree transiently.** An audited transition whose outbox row is undelivered is real and invisible; only the order read reflects it. This is acceptable and is why the read is never served from a replica.

### Confirmation

**This gear has no implementation and no runtime tests**, so the checks below are labelled either
verifiable today or planned.

**Verifiable today, by reading `design/01-foundation.md`.** §3.7 declares
`orders_event_outbox.event_id` as the primary key and the consumer de-duplication token stable
across a re-drive, `(order_id, sequence)` UNIQUE as what per-order ordering rests on, the
`sequence` allocated from a per-order counter under the aggregate row lock of §3.6, and one row
per event-declaring committed transition as an engine-enforced invariant. §4.4 states the
at-least-once contract, de-duplication by event ID, and that a parked entry is not an order state
and must not alter one. §3.6 *Attempt Transition* enqueues the row inside the transition
transaction, which is what makes enqueue-or-nothing atomic with the commit.

**Planned, not yet written.** A cross-table cardinality check for the one-outbox-row-per-
event-declaring-transition invariant — `01 §3.7` asserts that invariant but does not, as an
earlier draft of this section claimed, name a test for it; a check that a parked dead-letter row
alters no order state;
a check exercising sequence `n` failing before sequence `n+1` for the same order, which is what
would pin down the ordering dependency named in the Consequences above; and the drain-lag metric
measured against the 30 s budget separately from the commit budget, which is the measurement
`Q-16` needs in order to be answered. `01 §1.2`'s Verification Approach column is the home for
the first three; none is recorded there yet.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Transactional outbox with an asynchronous drain (chosen)

* Good, because enqueue and commit are one transaction, so an event can never be lost for a committed transition nor emitted for an uncommitted one.
* Good, because no network call sits inside the row lock.
* Good, because throughput scales with replicas up to the bucket count.
* Bad, because it makes PRD §7.1's combined threshold unsatisfiable and requires a PRD amendment.
* Bad, because consumers must de-duplicate and tolerate delay.

### Synchronous publish inside the transaction

* Good, because it satisfies the PRD's "durable write + event publish" wording literally.
* Good, because a consumer sees the change with no added delay.
* Bad, because broker latency becomes transition latency under the aggregate row lock.
* Bad, because it is not atomic across two systems, so the failure between them either drops the event or hides a committed transition.

### Publish after commit, in the same request

* Good, because the lock is released before the network call.
* Bad, because the atomicity gap remains, just smaller.
* Bad, because it still needs a reconciliation sweep, which is an outbox with extra steps.

### Change data capture off the write-ahead log

* Good, because it needs no application write path at all.
* Bad, because the events are a curated contract, not row images, so payload shaping would move outside this gear.
* Bad, because it couples three consumer gears to this gear's physical schema.

## More Information

Superseded by nothing. `DECISIONS.md` D-41 records the sharding and batching shape and the 30 s
budget; D-42 records the per-port deadlines that bound the *other* asynchronous cost. This ADR
exists because the 2026-09-10 review found the publication mode recorded only as a capacity-table
row, with the alternatives argued nowhere — while being the decision that makes a PRD acceptance
criterion unsatisfiable.

## Traceability

- **PRD**: [`../PRD.md`](../PRD.md) — §7.1 transition latency and audit completeness, §12 AC-17
- **DESIGN**: [`../design/01-foundation.md`](../design/01-foundation.md) §3.7 `orders_event_outbox`, §3.8, §4.4

This decision directly addresses the following requirements or design elements:

* `cpt-cf-bss-orders-lifecycle-fr-order-events` — the eleven events reach three consumer gears through the outbox; this decision fixes the delivery semantics as at-least-once with per-order ordering, and fixes the de-duplication key consumers must use
* `cpt-cf-bss-orders-lifecycle-nfr-order-transition-latency` — the decision removes the publish from the commit path, which is what lets the commit meet its budget, and is simultaneously why the PRD's combined "durable write + event publish" threshold cannot hold (`Q-16`)
* `cpt-cf-bss-orders-lifecycle-nfr-order-audit-completeness` — enqueue shares the transition transaction, so an event-declaring committed transition cannot exist without its outbox row; this is the "zero silent drops" guarantee at the egress boundary
* `cpt-cf-bss-orders-lifecycle-component-transition-engine` — the engine writes the outbox row and allocates its sequence under the aggregate row lock; the drain is a separate worker that mutates no order state
