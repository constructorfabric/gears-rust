//! The `cache_invalidate` broadcast: its body and the documents the Types
//! Registry holds for it. The body and its schemas live in the gear; only the
//! three identifiers (`ACTIVATION_SUBJECT_TYPE`, `CACHE_TOPIC_ID`,
//! `CACHE_INVALIDATE_EVENT_TYPE`) are part of the SDK, in `settings_service_sdk::gts`.
//!
//! Every replica of the gear publishes one [`CacheInvalidation`] per tenant a
//! request touched on the cache topic and consumes the ones its peers publish.
//! The body is a thin event (ADR-003): it names *what* changed, never *to
//! what*, so a replica re-reads through its ordinary authorization.
//!
//! The event type is a derived schema of the broker's event base and the topic
//! an instance of its topic base; the broker registers the bases, so the gear
//! registers these two once the broker resolves. The activation subject type is
//! this gear's own control-plane type and reaches the registry through the
//! link-time inventory, ahead of the gear's init, like the `setting_type` base.
