# FileStorage — Operational Configuration

This document covers every `FileStorageConfig` field (`gears/file-storage/file-storage/src/config.rs`), the sidecar's
own `FS_SIDECAR_*` environment variables (`gears/file-storage/file-storage/src/bin/sidecar.rs`), and the background
`CleanupEngine` sweep those config fields drive.

Every field below is verified against the current `default_*()` function or `main()`'s env-var parsing — each entry
names the function (or environment variable) that sets its default, rather than a line number, since line numbers
drift with every edit.

## Control-plane config: `FileStorageConfig`

All fields are `#[serde(default = "…")]`, so an operator's YAML only needs to override what it wants to change; a
gear started with no `file-storage` config section at all gets every default below — **except that it still cannot
actually boot**: `require_signing_key_seed` defaults to `true` with `signing_key_seed` unset, and
`FileStorageConfig::validate()` fails gear init on exactly that combination (see `require_signing_key_seed` below).
A genuinely zero-config deployment is dev/test-only (set `require_signing_key_seed: false` there).
`FileStorageConfig::validate()` (called at gear init, before anything is wired up) rejects **seven**
invalid configurations — three missing-secret/zero-interval guards (`sweep_interval_secs == 0` with the sweep
enabled; `signing_key_seed` absent while required; `finalize_internal_secret` absent while required) and four
cross-field ordering invariants (`default_url_ttl_secs` vs. `max_url_ttl_secs`; `default_page_size` vs.
`max_page_size`; `default_url_ttl_secs` vs. `orphan_grace_secs`; `multipart_session_ttl_secs` vs.
`default_url_ttl_secs`) — noted inline below. Function names (rather than line numbers) are used as source pointers
throughout this table since line numbers drift with every edit.

Config for this gear (like every gear on this platform) is loaded from its own platform YAML configuration section —
there is no standalone TOML/JSON file of its own.

### `default_url_ttl_secs`
Default TTL (seconds) baked into every signed URL the control plane mints (`900` = 15 minutes), unless the caller's
presign request or the code path explicitly asks for something else. Bounds the "stale-permission window" — how long
a URL remains valid after the authorization decision was made at signing (no per-token revocation exists). **Production
recommendation**: keep short (minutes, not hours) for anything not explicitly meant to be long-lived or
shareable; raise only for known bulk/batch workflows. **Misconfiguration risk**: too long → a leaked/logged URL stays
exploitable for the full window; too short → legitimate slow uploads/downloads may need to be re-presigned mid-flight
(no such retry-on-expiry logic exists in the SDK/handlers, so a very small value can break large transfers).

### `max_url_ttl_secs`
Hard ceiling (seconds) the control plane will mint any signed URL to (`604800` = 7 days); enforced by `Issuer::issue`
which clamps `exp` down to `now + max_url_ttl_secs` regardless of what was requested. **Production recommendation**:
leave at the 7-day default or lower for stricter environments; do not raise without a specific long-lived/anonymous-
sharing use case (a separate FileShare gear, not yet built, is the intended mechanism for that — not a raised ceiling
here). **Misconfiguration risk**: raising it widens the window during which a leaked URL is exploitable, with no
revocation mechanism to claw it back.

### `sidecar_base_url`
The externally-reachable base URL of the data-plane sidecar that every signed URL points at (default assumes a
sidecar on `localhost:8087`, i.e. **local dev only**). **Production recommendation**: must be set to the sidecar's
real public/internal address for the deployment topology (e.g. behind a load balancer in front of multiple sidecar
replicas). **Misconfiguration risk**: every signed upload/download URL embeds this host — if it is wrong or
unreachable from the client, every content operation fails even though the control plane itself is healthy; this is
easy to overlook because control-plane health checks and metadata CRUD (`GET /files`, etc.) will look fine.

### `default_page_size` / `max_page_size`
Pagination defaults/ceiling for `GET /files` (and similar list endpoints) — `50` / `1000` respectively.
**Production recommendation**: the defaults are reasonable starting points; raise `max_page_size` only if clients
have a proven need for larger pages and the DB/latency budget supports it. **Misconfiguration risk**: a very large
`max_page_size` lets a caller force an expensive, unbounded-feeling listing query; a `default_page_size` larger than
`max_page_size` would be self-contradictory — `FileStorageConfig::validate()` rejects this combination at startup.

### `storage_root`
Local filesystem root for the default `local-fs` backend (default `./.file-storage-data`, i.e. **relative to the
process's working directory** — not durable across container image rebuilds unless mounted). **Production
recommendation**: point at a durable, backed-up volume mount; never leave at the relative default in a containerized
deployment. **Misconfiguration risk**: content written under an ephemeral/container-local path is lost on
pod/container recreation — this is a **silent data-loss** risk since writes will appear to succeed.

### `signing_key_seed`
Base64url-encoded 32-byte Ed25519 seed for the URL-signing keypair. When set, the keypair (and the public key the
sidecar verifies against) is **stable across restarts**; when absent, `gear.rs::init` generates an ephemeral key
every boot (logged at `info` level with an explicit warning). **Production recommendation**: always set this in any
real deployment, and treat it as a secret (same handling tier as any other private key material) — never log or
serialize it (`FileStorageConfig`'s manual `Debug` impl redacts it deliberately). **Multi-replica warning**: every
replica must be configured with the **same** seed. If replicas each generate their own ephemeral key (i.e. the seed
is unset in a multi-replica deployment), signed URLs minted by one replica fail verification at the sidecar (which
is configured with only one public key via `FS_SIDECAR_PUBLIC_KEY`) — this looks like intermittent, replica-dependent
upload/download failures. `require_signing_key_seed` (below) exists specifically to fail fast on this misconfiguration
instead of degrading silently into that failure mode.

### `require_signing_key_seed`
When `true` (the default), `FileStorageConfig::validate()` makes gear init **fail fast** if `signing_key_seed` is
absent, instead of silently minting an ephemeral per-boot key. **Production recommendation**: leave at `true`
everywhere except local dev/test harnesses that construct a `FileStorageConfig` directly and intentionally want the
ephemeral-key behaviour — set `false` explicitly there. **Misconfiguration risk**: setting `false` in a real
multi-replica deployment removes the fail-fast guard and re-opens the "different key per replica" failure mode
described above, deferred from a loud startup error to a confusing runtime symptom.

### `idempotency_ttl_secs`
Window (seconds, default `86400` = 24h) an `idempotency_keys` row (from `POST /files`'s `idempotency_key`) remains
valid for replay-detection; after this, a retry with the same key is treated as a brand-new request. Expired rows
are reclaimed by the cleanup sweep's step 4 (see below). **Production recommendation**: size to the longest
realistic client retry window (default is generous for most HTTP retry policies). **Misconfiguration risk**: too
short → a legitimately delayed retry (e.g. after a long client-side backoff) creates a duplicate file instead of
being deduplicated; too long → more rows accumulate between sweep passes (bounded by `sweep_interval_secs`, not a
correctness issue, just storage/index bloat).

### `orphan_grace_secs`
Grace period (seconds, default `3600` = 1h) a `pending` version or an expired multipart session must age past
before the cleanup sweep reclaims it. **Production recommendation**: the default balances "reclaim abandoned uploads
promptly" against "don't race a slow-but-legitimate in-flight upload." **Misconfiguration risk**: too short → a
slow client upload can have its `pending` version reclaimed (and blob deleted) out from under it mid-upload,
surfacing as a finalize `404`/`400`; too long → abandoned pending rows and their blobs linger longer, using storage.

### `sweep_interval_secs`
How often (seconds, default `3600` = 1h) the background cleanup sweep fires, when `enable_background_sweep` is
`true`. `FileStorageConfig::validate()` **rejects** `sweep_interval_secs == 0` combined with
`enable_background_sweep == true` at startup (a zero interval would otherwise spin the sweep loop tightly, pegging
the runtime and flooding logs). **Production recommendation**: the 1-hour default is reasonable for most deployments;
tighten it if orphan reconciliation / retention-driven deletion needs to be closer to real-time. **Misconfiguration
risk**: too long → orphaned pending versions, expired multipart sessions, retention-expired files, and expired
idempotency keys all accumulate for longer between passes (storage growth, and retention-policy compliance windows
run wider than the policy nominally states).

### `enable_background_sweep`
When `true` (**the default**), the cleanup sweep loop starts at gear init. **Production recommendation**: leave at
`true` in every real deployment; set `false` only in test/dev harnesses that construct a `FileStorageConfig` directly
(not via YAML) and need fully deterministic behavior (no background task racing test assertions). **Misconfiguration
risk**: `false` in production means **no** orphan reconciliation, **no** expired-multipart cleanup, **no**
retention-policy enforcement, and **no** idempotency-key garbage collection ever run — pending versions and
abandoned multipart sessions accumulate indefinitely, retention rules become inert (a compliance-relevant silent
failure, since a configured retention policy will appear to exist via `GET /retention-rules` but never actually
delete anything), and `idempotency_keys` grows without bound.

### `enable_in_memory_backend`
When `true` (default `false`), an additional non-durable backend registered under the id `memory` (`MEMORY_ID`,
`gear.rs`) is registered alongside the default `local-fs` backend. **Production recommendation**: leave at `false`
in any deployment where data loss is unacceptable — the in-memory backend loses all content on restart. Its only
legitimate use is dev/test scenarios that want a second backend id to exercise multi-backend code paths (e.g.
`migrate_backend`) without provisioning real durable storage; it is also the simplest way to get a `multipart_native`
backend for exercising multipart upload without configuring S3 (see `default_backend_id` below). **Misconfiguration
risk**: enabling it in production, combined with a file or policy that routes content onto it, is **silent, guaranteed
data loss** on the next restart — `migrate_backend` additionally requires the caller's `ADMIN_POLICY` authorization
scope (not just `WRITE`) specifically to make this an explicit, elevated-privilege action rather than an accident.

### `s3_backends`
Zero or more S3-compatible backends (`S3BackendConfig` entries: `id`, `endpoint`, `region`, `bucket`,
`access_key_id`, `secret_access_key`, `path_style`) registered alongside `local-fs` (and `memory` if enabled). Empty
by default — a deployment opts in explicitly. Each entry becomes one `S3Backend` in the registry, keyed by its own
`id`; ids must be unique across the whole registry (`BackendRegistry::new` rejects a collision at startup). S3
support is gated by [ADR-0005](./ADR/0005-cpt-cf-file-storage-adr-s3-client-selection.md), whose status is
`proposed` pending a team security review of its external HTTP-signing/XML-parsing dependencies; the code builds and
is tested regardless, but merging it to `main` is conditioned on that review. **Production recommendation**: omit
`access_key_id`/`secret_access_key` and resolve credentials from the process environment
(`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`/`AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`) instead of embedding them in gear YAML. **Misconfiguration risk**: a bad
endpoint or missing credentials with no env fallback fails gear init (fail-fast, not a runtime surprise).

### `default_backend_id`
Backend id `build_backend_registry` designates as the registry's default — the backend new `create`/
`initiate_multipart` calls write to. `None` (the default) keeps `local-fs` as the default. Set this to one of
`s3_backends`' configured ids to make that S3 backend the default instead. **Misconfiguration risk**: an id that
does not name a registered backend surfaces as a fail-fast gear-init error, never a panic.

`POST /files/{id}/multipart` (initiate) always targets this default backend, and requires it to advertise the
`multipart_native` capability. `local-fs` does **not** advertise `multipart_native`, so multipart uploads are
unavailable against the plain default configuration; switch the default to a configured S3 backend, or to the
dev/test `memory` backend (`enable_in_memory_backend` above), to enable multipart uploads. See `docs/api.md`'s
"P2 — Multipart upload" section.

### `finalize_internal_secret`
Interim gear-local shared secret the s2s finalize/report-part callback routes additionally require, on top of the
signed upload token, via the `x-fs-internal-token` request header. `None` (the default) preserves the token-only
trust model. This is a stop-gap until the platform's `toolkit-security::internal_auth` profiles are deployable in
this gear (see [ADR-0003](./ADR/0003-cpt-cf-file-storage-adr-sidecar-data-plane.md)'s trust-model section).
**Production recommendation**: set this to a strong shared secret and set the matching `FS_SIDECAR_INTERNAL_TOKEN`
on every sidecar talking to this control plane, then flip `require_finalize_internal_secret` to `true`. Never
logged (`FileStorageConfig`'s manual `Debug` impl redacts it).

### `require_finalize_internal_secret`
When `true`, gear init fails fast if `finalize_internal_secret` is absent instead of silently accepting the
token-only trust model for the finalize/report-part callbacks. Mirrors `require_signing_key_seed`. Defaults to
`false` so existing deployments — and any sidecar not yet redeployed with `FS_SIDECAR_INTERNAL_TOKEN` — keep
working. **Production recommendation**: flip to `true` only after every sidecar talking to this control plane has
been redeployed with the matching `FS_SIDECAR_INTERNAL_TOKEN` env var (see the migration-path note in the ADR).

## Sidecar config: `FS_SIDECAR_*` environment variables

The sidecar is a separate binary/process (`src/bin/sidecar.rs`) with its own env-var configuration — it does **not**
share `FileStorageConfig`. All of these are read once in `main()`.

| Variable | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `FS_SIDECAR_ADDR` | `0.0.0.0:8087` | Bind address. |
| `FS_SIDECAR_PUBLIC_KEY` | **required, no default** | Base64url Ed25519 public key; must match the control plane's `signing_key_seed`-derived keypair (see above). Startup fails (`anyhow::anyhow!`) if unset or malformed. |
| `FS_SIDECAR_BACKEND_ROOT` | `./.file-storage-data` | Local-fs backend root — same durability caveat as the control plane's `storage_root`; the two should point at the **same** underlying storage for a single-backend deployment, or the sidecar will read/write blobs the control plane's metadata doesn't expect to find there. |
| `FS_SIDECAR_CONTROL_URL` | `http://localhost:8080` | Base URL of the control plane, used for the finalize/report-part callbacks. Setting it to the **empty string** explicitly disables the callback (dev/test only) — uploaded versions then stay `pending` forever, since nothing ever calls finalize; production must always set this to a reachable control-plane URL. |
| `FS_SIDECAR_MAX_BODY_BYTES` | `5368709120` (5 GiB) | Raises axum's blanket request-body floor (default 2 MiB) for the `PUT` route. This is a transport-layer ceiling only — the real per-request limit is the signed token's `max_size`/`exact_size` claim. **Misconfiguration risk**: setting it below the largest policy-permitted single-part upload causes legitimate uploads to be rejected at the transport layer before the token-level check even runs. |
| `FS_SIDECAR_FINALIZE_TIMEOUT_SECS` | `10` | Total request timeout for the sidecar → control-plane finalize/report-part callbacks. |
| `FS_SIDECAR_FINALIZE_CONNECT_TIMEOUT_SECS` | `5` | Connect timeout for the same callbacks. Together with the timeout above, bounds how long a client's upload request can be held open by an unreachable or hung control plane — without these timeouts, a hung control plane could block the client indefinitely. **Misconfiguration risk**: too low in a high-latency network path causes spurious `502 Bad Gateway` responses to clients on otherwise-successful uploads; too high re-opens the "held open indefinitely" problem these timeouts exist to close. |
| `FS_SIDECAR_INTERNAL_TOKEN` | unset (header omitted) | Interim shared secret sent as `x-fs-internal-token` on both the finalize and report-part control-plane callbacks — the sidecar's half of the control plane's `finalize_internal_secret`/`require_finalize_internal_secret` (see above). Unset/empty = the header is not sent, matching a control plane with the check disabled. Must match the control plane's configured secret once it flips `require_finalize_internal_secret` on. |
| `FS_SIDECAR_S3_BACKENDS` | unset (no S3 backends) | Optional JSON array of `S3BackendConfig` entries (mirrors the control plane's `s3_backends`), folded into the sidecar's own `BackendRegistry` alongside the always-present `local-fs` backend so a control-plane-registered `S3Backend` is reachable by real traffic dispatched per-request via `claims.backend_id`. Credentials embedded in this JSON blob are acceptable for the sidecar (the one component authorized to hold them, per ADR-0003) but should be sourced from a secrets manager / mounted file in production where supported. |

Every `FS_SIDECAR_*` numeric env var (`FS_SIDECAR_MAX_BODY_BYTES`, the two timeout vars) fails sidecar startup with a
descriptive error if the value is *set but does not parse* (`parse_optional`/`parse_env_or_default`,
`src/bin/sidecar.rs`) — it does **not** silently fall back to the default on a typo like
`FS_SIDECAR_MAX_BODY_BYTES=5GB`. Only a genuinely unset variable uses the default.

A failed finalize/report-part callback (after the sidecar's retry budget, see `post_with_retry` /
`CALLBACK_MAX_ATTEMPTS` in `src/bin/sidecar.rs`) returns `502 Bad Gateway` to the client. The upload itself is
**idempotent** (the backend `PUT` is overwrite-safe), so the documented recovery is: the client retries the upload
via a fresh `PUT` to the same signed URL, or — for the finalize case specifically — the version may already be
correctly finalized server-side even though the client saw a transient `502` on a preceding attempt (re-verify via
`GET /files/{id}/versions` before assuming failure).

## The background cleanup sweep

`CleanupEngine::run_sweep` (`src/domain/cleanup.rs`) is the single entry point for the whole background lifecycle
job the gear schedules on a `sweep_interval_secs` timer when `enable_background_sweep` is `true` (see `gear.rs`).
Each step is **best-effort**: a failure in one step is logged at `warn` and does not abort the rest of the sweep, and
every operation is written to be safely idempotent under concurrent sweeps (no cross-instance leader election exists
today — every replica runs its own sweep independently; cross-instance coordination is expected in a future release).

The sweep runs **four** steps, in this order:

1. **Abandoned-pending sweep** (`cpt-cf-file-storage-fr-orphan-reconciliation`) — deletes `file_versions` rows still
   `pending` (pre-registered but never finalized) older than `orphan_grace_secs`, best-effort deletes their backend
   blobs, and additionally deletes the parent `files` row too if reclaiming its last pending version leaves it a
   permanent zero-version orphan (no versions left **and** `content_id IS NULL`, and no blocking in-progress
   multipart session for that file). This zero-version file cleanup is not a separate fifth sweep step; it is
   folded into step 1's per-version cleanup.
2. **Expired-multipart sweep** — aborts `multipart_uploads` sessions still `in_progress` whose `expires_at` has
   passed: wins the session's own `in_progress → aborted` CAS first (racing a concurrent `complete`/user-`abort`),
   and only on winning that race does it tell the backend to discard the in-progress upload and delete the
   associated pending version row.
3. **Retention-expiry sweep** (`cpt-cf-file-storage-fr-retention-policies`) — keyset-paginated (500 files per page,
   `RETENTION_SWEEP_BATCH`) scan of every file across every tenant, evaluated against all stored retention rules
   (tenant/user/file scope; age, inactivity, or custom-metadata-value criteria, OR-combined). A matching file is
   deleted through the same transactional-outbox path a user-initiated `DELETE` uses, so a `file.deleted` event is
   still emitted. Skipped entirely (no file scan at all) when zero retention rules are configured, for cheapness.
4. **Idempotency-key GC** — deletes `idempotency_keys` rows past their `expires_at` (governed by
   `idempotency_ttl_secs`). Deliberately does **not** touch `audit_outbox`/`events_outbox`: rows in those tables are
   inserted with `published_at = NULL` and nothing in this gear ever sets it — no relay currently drains either
   outbox table, so an age-based purge here would silently drop rows that were never delivered. Both tables
   therefore grow without bound until an `EventBroker` relay exists to drain them.

## Idempotent-create semantics

`POST /files` accepts an optional `idempotency_key`. A retry with the same key, by the same `(tenant_id, owner_kind,
owner_id)`, within `idempotency_ttl_secs`, returns the original response instead of creating a second file — guarded
by two checks, both of which must pass:

- **Subject binding**: the stored row's `subject_id` (the authenticated caller who created the key) must match
  `ctx.subject_id()` on replay; a mismatch is `Forbidden`, not a silent fresh-create fallthrough. Pre-migration rows
  are backfilled with the nil UUID, which can never match a real subject.
- **Request-body binding**: a SHA-256 `request_hash` over the identity-relevant fields (`name`, `gts_file_type`,
  `mime_type`, `custom_metadata`) is recomputed on replay and compared; a mismatch is `409 Conflict` ("idempotency
  key reused with a different request body"), rather than silently replaying the original ticket for a request the
  caller never actually made.

See `docs/migration.sql`'s `idempotency_keys` table and `docs/api.md`'s `409` summary for the wire-level contract.

## Storage quota (not enforced)

`FileService` and `MultipartService` both accept an optional `quota_client: Option<Arc<dyn QuotaClient>>` and call
`check_quota` / `check_quota_bytes` (`src/domain/service/create.rs`, `src/domain/multipart_service.rs`) before every
storage-increasing operation (`create_file`, `presign_version`, multipart initiate) — see the `QuotaClient` trait in
`src/infra/external_clients.rs`. That consumer-side port is designed to fail **closed**: if a wired client's
`check_storage_quota` call returns an error, the error propagates and the request is denied (see
`tests/enforce_test.rs`).

There is no config knob for this in the table above because there is nothing to configure yet — `gear.rs`
unconditionally constructs both services with `quota_client: None`. When `None`, `check_quota`/`check_quota_bytes`
short-circuit to `Ok(())`. **Storage quota is not enforced in any deployment**: the effective behavior is permissive
/ fail-**open**, not the fail-closed behavior the port was designed for. No `QuotaClient` implementation exists to
wire in — the Quota Enforcement gear (`gears/system/quota-enforcement/`) is docs-only (PRD/DESIGN/ADRs, no Rust
crate, no SDK). **Operators must not assume any storage limit is in effect** until this is wired.

Similarly, there is no usage reporter wired: `FileService`, `MultipartService`, and `CleanupEngine` all accept an
optional usage-reporting sink and `gear.rs` constructs every one of them with `None`, so no usage deltas are ever
reported anywhere today.

Content-hash modes (whole-object SHA-256 for single-part uploads; a multipart offset-manifest composite SHA-256 for
multipart uploads) are implemented — see [ADR-0006](./ADR/0006-cpt-cf-file-storage-adr-content-hash-modes.md) and
`docs/features/content-hash-modes.md`. The `hash_mode`/`part_count` columns and the `version_hash_manifest` table
were added by migration `m20260707_000001_content_hash_modes`.

## The `SignatureProvider` / `SignatureVerifier` abstraction

Signing and verification of the URL-signing token are behind an in-house trait pair
(`infra::signed_url::SignatureProvider` / `SignatureVerifier`), not called directly against a hard-wired crypto
library. The implementation is Ed25519 (`Issuer::from_seed`/`Issuer::generate`), codec-equivalent to
PASETO `v4.public` (see `docs/api.md`'s "Signed URLs" section). The abstraction exists specifically for **FIPS
posture**: a FIPS-validated deployment needs the sign/verify primitive to run inside a FIPS-validated module (the
platform's `rustls-corecrypto-provider`); the trait boundary lets that primitive be swapped (e.g. for ECDSA P-256)
without any change to the token's opaque wire format or any client-visible change. See
[ADR-0004](./ADR/0004-cpt-cf-file-storage-adr-signed-url-transport.md) "FIPS posture" for the full rationale.
