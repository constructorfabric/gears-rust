# `CredStore`

Stateful credential-storage gear module. Owns per-secret metadata in its own
database, enforces authorization in SQL, resolves secrets hierarchically across
the tenant tree, and stores the secret **value** in a backend plugin discovered
via the types registry.

> Design: the [technical design](https://github.com/constructorfabric/gears-rust/blob/main/gears/credstore/docs/DESIGN.md) is the baseline; the decision to
> ship a stateful gear (`credstore_secrets` table, PDP-scope authz,
> versioning/ETag, write saga) instead of the original stateless design is
> recorded in [ADR-0001](https://github.com/constructorfabric/gears-rust/blob/main/gears/credstore/docs/ADR/0001-cpt-cf-credstore-adr-stateful-gear.md);
> the addendum document that used to carry this history was folded into that
> ADR and removed (see git history for its prior content).

## Overview

The `cf-gears-credstore` module provides:

- **Local metadata** — a gear-owned `credstore_secrets` table (`SecureORM` /
  sea-orm, migrations `m0001` + `m0002`) holding sharing, owner, status,
  `version`, `fallback`, a `value_id` pointer to the row's current
  immutable backend version, and the value-fingerprint fence
- **One item shape for the record and its secret** — the point read and the
  collection return the same shape; `secret` is present only when the
  caller's `$select` names it, under `read_secret`; a credential can be
  created without a secret, by an explicit `null`, which is also how a
  tenant suppresses an inherited credential with no row of its own
  ([ADR-0004](https://github.com/constructorfabric/gears-rust/blob/main/gears/credstore/docs/ADR/0004-cpt-cf-credstore-adr-secret-value-exposure.md),
  [ADR-0007](https://github.com/constructorfabric/gears-rust/blob/main/gears/credstore/docs/ADR/0007-cpt-cf-credstore-adr-record-write-verbs.md),
  [ADR-0008](https://github.com/constructorfabric/gears-rust/blob/main/gears/credstore/docs/ADR/0008-cpt-cf-credstore-adr-suppression-fallback.md))
- **PDP authorization** — six actions on the credential type (`list`,
  `read`, `write`, `delete` on the record; `read_secret`, `write_secret` on
  the secret, [ADR-0010](https://github.com/constructorfabric/gears-rust/blob/main/gears/credstore/docs/ADR/0010-cpt-cf-credstore-adr-type-scoped-authorization.md)),
  `AccessScope` enforced in SQL via `SecureORM` clamps; out-of-scope access
  is fail-closed (canonical 404, anti-enumeration)
- **Hierarchical resolution** — a single indexed query over the ancestor chain
  (TTL+LRU cached, barriers ignored — `shared` inherits through them); the backend is read once for the winner's value
- **Value-fingerprint fence** — every read verifies the backend value against a
  per-row `HMAC-SHA256` (key auto-stored in the backend, never on the wire), so
  a metadata/value desync from a concurrent write fails closed instead of
  disclosing a value under a foreign sharing label (DESIGN §4.10, ADR-0003);
  an integrity check with no healing path — recovery is an ordinary new write
- **Versioning** — strong generation-bound `ETag` (`"<id>.<version>"`) on `GET`,
  mandatory `If-Match` on `PUT`/`DELETE` (a validator, or `*` for explicit
  last-writer-wins; no ABA across recreation)
- **Crash-safe writes** — each value is a new immutable version under a fresh
  id; the row's pointer switches in one transaction after the bytes are
  written; old versions are deleted by the writer right after the switch —
  that is the cleanup path; leftovers (a failed writer-side delete, or a
  crash) and expired records are removed by a periodic maintenance job, not
  an in-process reaper
- **Backend plugin** — value-only store discovered via the types registry (vendor)
- **`ClientHub` + REST** — registers `CredStoreClientV1` and `CredStoreMaintenanceV1`; exposes `/credstore/v1/credentials`

This module depends on `types-registry`, `tenant-resolver`, and `authz-resolver`,
and **requires a database**. The secret value is stored in a plugin (e.g.
`cf-gears-static-credstore-plugin`, or
[`cf-gears-vault-credstore-plugin`](../plugins/vault-credstore-plugin/README.md)
(prototype), backed by Vault/OpenBao).

A credential is created in one request — a `PUT` on the record address
carries the record and a tri-state `secret` together: a string writes it,
and an explicit `null` creates the record without one (`declared`), which
is also how a tenant suppresses an inherited credential without a row of
its own. A merge-`PATCH` on the same address edits metadata or
rotates/removes the secret without touching the rest of the record; and the
secret is read by naming it in `$select` on that same address or on the
collection — there is no dedicated secret address. Every value write mints
a fresh version id, switches the row's pointer to it in one transaction,
and deletes the version it replaced right after — the model of Vault KV v2
and the cloud secret managers, shadow paging with a `git gc`-style
collector; a periodic maintenance job, run on an operator-chosen schedule
outside the gear (no resident reaper), collects whatever that best-effort
delete missed.

## Usage

After the gear initializes, consumers obtain its client from `ClientHub`. This
example reads a secret value (`get_secret`, the `read_secret` action) without
formatting or logging it; the record itself is read with `get` (`read`):

```no_run
use std::error::Error;

use credstore_sdk::{CredStoreClientV1, SecretRef};
use toolkit::ClientHub;
use toolkit_security::SecurityContext;

async fn secret_length(
    hub: &ClientHub,
    security: &SecurityContext,
) -> Result<Option<usize>, Box<dyn Error>> {
    let credstore = hub.get::<dyn CredStoreClientV1>()?;
    let key = SecretRef::new("my-api-key")?;
    let secret = credstore.get_secret(security, &key).await?;

    Ok(secret.map(|s| s.secret.as_bytes().len()))
}
```

## Configuration

The module requires a `database:` section (it is stateful). Gear config:

```yaml
credstore:
  database:
    server: "sqlite_users"   # a database server template; module gets its own file
    file: "credstore.db"
  config:
    vendor: "constructorfabric" # GTS vendor used to discover the value-store plugin
    hierarchy:
      ancestor_cache_ttl_secs: 300
    gc:                          # settings of the maintenance job (ADR-0006); no resident reaper
      pending_max_age_secs: 3600 # a pending write intent older than this is reclaimed by the job
      batch_size: 256            # rows per batch in the job's expiry and gc passes
    list:
      max_limit: 200             # metadata-mode page-size cap
      secret_mode_cap: 25        # secret-mode ($select=…,secret) match-set cap
```
