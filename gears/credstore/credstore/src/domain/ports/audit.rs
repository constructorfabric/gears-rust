//! Audit port for secret reads and writes (`cpt-cf-credstore-nfr-audit`).
//!
//! The domain service reports every disclosure and every change of a secret
//! through [`AuditSink`] once the operation's outcome is known. The port is
//! deliberately infallible and carries no secret: an implementation owns the
//! best-effort contract (bounded wait, log without the secret, count the
//! failure) so that no audit problem can reach a caller of the service.
