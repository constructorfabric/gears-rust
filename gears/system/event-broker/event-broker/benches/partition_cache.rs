//! What the partition cache's two hot paths cost, and whether either scales
//! with something it should not.
//!
//! Run with `cargo bench -p cf-gears-event-broker --bench partition_cache`.
//!
//! Both benchmarks exist because the code they measure was once wrong in a way
//! only a curve reveals. `absorb_into_resident` sweeps how much the cache is
//! already holding: absorbing used to concatenate exactly-adjacent segments,
//! deep-copying every resident event on every fetch, so its cost rose with
//! residency - and the steady state is precisely the adjacent case. Segments
//! are no longer merged, so this curve should be flat. `read_one_batch` sweeps
//! payload size: measuring an event's size used to mean serializing its payload
//! to a string and discarding it, once per event per read, so reading cost rose
//! with payload bytes. Sizes are now summed once at absorb into a cumulative
//! index, so this curve should be flat too.
//!
//! A flat line is the result for both. A rising one means a regression to the
//! shape these paths were rewritten to escape.
//!
//! `read_across_segments` is the counterweight, and it is *not* flat by design:
//! never merging means a read spanning several fetches has to visit each of
//! them, and it measures what that costs. Around thirty nanoseconds per extra
//! segment crossed, against a per-absorb saving that grows without bound with
//! residency, is the trade this design makes.
