## Context and Problem Statement

The gear meters, retains, aggregates and feeds. Pricing, rating and invoice
generation sit outside its scope and belong to a downstream consumer. The gear
therefore hands off, and the question is where that hand-off happens.

Three read surfaces are candidates. The raw query path serves entries as
persisted. The aggregate path applies the declared fold over a requested range.
The feed serves entries in acceptance order under a subscription.

The question is architectural rather than a routing detail, because the answer
fixes what each surface must guarantee. A surface that feeds a charge owes
ordering, a snapshot, a bounded replay window, and a staleness bound a consumer
can detect. A surface that feeds a chart owes none of those.

The two audiences differ in what they tolerate. Aggregation's natural audience is
dashboards, quota evaluation and reconciliation. Such a consumer tolerates
bounded staleness and never computes an invoice. A charging consumer tolerates
neither staleness it cannot detect nor a number it cannot reproduce.

## Decision Drivers

- A charge must be reproducible — a consumer that recomputes a period obtains the
  number it charged, from the identified entries the charge derived from.
- A charge must be attributable — a dispute resolves against named entries with
  their identifiers, covered periods, correction linkage and reason codes. A
  total names nothing.
- Staleness must be detectable — a charging consumer has to prove it has seen a
  closed period, which needs a watermark and per-scope reconciliation metadata.
- `cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-billing-usage-feed` — requires a deterministic,
  replay-safe pull path over entries. This decision states which consumer that
  path exists for.
- Materialisation must stay available on the aggregate path — the throughput
  profile and the retention floor put tens of billions of entries in residence.
  A per-query scan over them cannot hold p95 ≤ 500 ms.
- Plugin neutrality — every freshness obligation must be expressible as a
  per-plugin readiness gate, because the gear floor publishes no upper bound
  (`cpt-cf-usage-collector-nfr-query-freshness`).
- Bounded recovery — the replay obligation must scale with what a consumer
  subscribes to, not with platform-wide telemetry volume.
- Prior art — every surveyed metering substrate that hands off to a rating layer
  hands off entries. The surveyed systems that serve totals own rating
  themselves.

## Considered Options

- A dedicated pull feed for entries, with aggregates as a derived view — the feed
  carries entries under a subscription in acceptance order. The aggregate path
  becomes a derived read path with its own freshness gate.
- Aggregates only, with the per-entry read paths removed — the gear serves one
  number per meter, period and grouping. The feed, the raw query path and point
  lookup all go away.
- Raw query polling as the feed — a consumer polls the raw query path with a
  forward cursor over event time. It treats the pages as its stream.
- Push through the event broker — the gear publishes every accepted entry to the
  platform event broker, and a charging consumer subscribes.

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "A dedicated pull feed for entries, with aggregates as a derived
view". A charging consumer reads the feed and derives its charges from entries.

The feed carries the obligations that follow from that role. It is pull-based
over the Downstream Usage Reader Contract. A consumer declares the set of GTS
types it rates, and the Feed Gateway excludes everything else from the pages, the
cursor and the watermark. Pages are ordered by an acceptance sequence that is
strictly monotonic per tenant and type, and no cross-tenant or cross-type total
order is claimed. The gateway owns the cursor encoding, and a plugin never mints,
encodes or interprets one. Every page carries a watermark that holds for every
subscribed scope.

The storage plugin assigns the acceptance sequence, because only an atomic
operation against the store guarantees monotonicity. The assignment therefore
belongs where the entry lands. This decision's ordering guarantee depends on the
sequence being assigned at acceptance, not on which component assigns it.

A paginated scan observes a snapshot, and the append-only ledger purchases that
property. No accepted entry is ever rewritten. A correction arrives as a later
invalidation entry at its own acceptance position, so a scan has nothing to
observe changing. Append-only arrivals are the one carve-out, and the watermark
returned with each page demarcates them.

The snapshot is therefore prefix-stable rather than frozen. A replay from a
cursor returns every entry the original scan returned, in the same order and at
the same position, extended only by entries accepted since. A consumer that
stops at a watermark it recorded reads an identical page. That watermark, not
the cursor, is the snapshot boundary.

Three zones govern a rewound cursor
(`cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-billing-retention-floor`). A cursor no older than the
operational replay horizon is served, and that is the guarantee a charging
consumer codes against. Between that horizon and the retention floor, service is
plugin-dependent and a consumer relies on none of it. A cursor older than the
retention floor is refused with an actionable error. The Feed Gateway never
serves a silently truncated range.

The feed delivers both entries of a withdrawn pair, each at its own acceptance
position. The two can land in different pages, because an invalidation is
accepted after its target. Excluding the pair is therefore the consumer's step,
taken when it folds, and the feed never excludes it. A consumer never treats a
target as final because the page carrying it held no invalidation.

The aggregate path is a derived view. It computes the declared fold and states
nothing a consumer cannot, in principle, compute from the entries themselves. Its
audience is dashboards, quota evaluation and reconciliation.

Because the path is derived, a plugin can serve it from a pre-computed or
materialised representation. The freshness obligation is therefore a per-plugin
readiness gate (`cpt-cf-usage-collector-nfr-aggregate-freshness`) rather than a
gear-level floor. An accepted invalidation obliges a materialised aggregate to
recompute over the affected range. Such an aggregate never absorbs the withdrawal
as a further contribution, because `MAX`, `MIN` and `LATEST` admit no reversing
term.

The boundary is one rule a reader can apply.

> A consumer that computes money reads entries, not aggregates.

Stated normatively: a charging consumer reads the feed, and derives no charge
from an aggregate response. A consumer that only displays, throttles or
reconciles can read either surface.

Reading the feed does not make every meter chargeable. The consumer applies the
declared fold rather than one of its own choosing, and only `SUM` yields a
chargeable period quantity. `MAX`, `MIN` and `LATEST` are descriptive folds
(`cpt-cf-usage-collector-adr-declared-fold`). A meter declaring one of those
characterises a series and states no amount consumed.

### The raw query path is not the feed

Event time on an entry is emitter-supplied, and the live path accepts it back to
the configured past tolerance while backfill accepts its whole window. An entry
can therefore be inserted at a position a forward event-time cursor has already
passed. The consumer never receives that entry and cannot detect the omission.

The hole exists on a fully converged single node. It is therefore not a
replica-lag problem, and no plugin consistency ceiling closes it. The feed orders
by acceptance sequence, which is assigned at acceptance, so a newly accepted
entry always lands ahead of a forward cursor. The raw path stays an audit,
debugging and dispute-resolution surface (`cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-query-raw`).

### Consequences

- A deployment whose active plugin publishes no qualifying feed-freshness ceiling
  cannot feed a charging consumer. The condition is a storage-plugin readiness
  gate, verified at review beside the retention floor.
- The replay obligation is bounded by subscription scope. The required read rate
  is at least the subscribed arrival rate multiplied by one plus the ratio of
  backlog age to recovery time. At the launch objective that is five times the
  subscribed arrival rate, and a consumer never pays for traffic it does not
  read.
- Reconciliation metadata and watermarks exist so a consumer can prove it has
  seen a closed period. Per-scope counts, the acceptance-instant watermark, the
  covered-period-end watermark and the acceptance-sequence watermark carry that
  proof. The gear evaluates none of them and raises no stall signal.
- The retention floor is what makes replay meaningful. It sums the backfill
  window and the operational replay horizon, so every accepted entry keeps one
  full horizon from the moment it becomes readable. A cursor past the floor is
  refused rather than silently truncated.
- Two freshness obligations exist rather than one. Feed lag and aggregate lag are
  different mechanisms with different bounds, so each plugin publishes them
  separately. A plugin quoting one number for both overstates one of them.
- The aggregate path being derived is what makes pre-aggregation legitimate. A
  charging path served from a materialised rollup is not legitimate, because a
  consumer cannot reproduce the charge from named entries.
- The Feed Gateway stays a component distinct from the Query Gateway. It orders
  by arrival rather than by covered period, and its snapshot and watermark
  obligations have no analogue on the query paths.
- Retaining entries keeps a recovery path open that an aggregates-only surface
  closes. A meter whose fold was bound wrongly can be re-read and reprocessed
  from the entries, inside the retention floor. An aggregate computed under the
  wrong fold is not recoverable from the aggregate.

### Confirmation

- Feed contract tests covering prefix stability and replay determinism. The same
  cursor yields the same continuation, extended only by entries accepted since,
  and a replay from a cursor inside the operational replay horizon observes the
  entries the original scan observed, in the same order. A replay bounded by a
  recorded watermark is identical, entry for entry.
- An acceptance-sequence monotonicity test per tenant and type, run under
  concurrent ingestion of measurements and invalidation entries.
- A replay-refusal test. A cursor older than the retention floor returns an
  actionable error rather than a short page.
- A recovery test against a subscription at the NFR envelope. A 24-hour backlog
  clears within 6 hours while entries keep arriving, with ingestion p95 inside
  its bound throughout.
- Storage-plugin release-readiness review confirming both published ceilings:
  acceptance to feed visibility, and acceptance to aggregate visibility with its
  invalidation-propagation bound.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### A dedicated pull feed for entries, with aggregates as a derived view

The feed carries entries under a subscription in acceptance order. The aggregate
path serves the declared fold to consumers that never compute a charge.

- Good, because a charge stays reproducible. A consumer recomputes a period from
  named entries and obtains the number it charged.
- Good, because a dispute resolves against identified entries, with covered
  periods, correction linkage and reason codes intact.
- Good, because acceptance-sequence ordering has no late-arrival hole. A sequence
  assigned at acceptance always lands ahead of a forward cursor.
- Good, because it frees the aggregate path to be materialised. Close-query cost
  then scales with buckets served rather than with entries ingested.
- Good, because subscription scoping keeps the replay obligation proportionate to
  the meters a consumer actually rates.
- Neutral, because the gear publishes two freshness bounds instead of one. Each
  bound is honest, and each is a per-plugin gate rather than a gear promise.
- Bad, because a charging consumer does more work. It manages a cursor, applies
  the declared fold on its own side, and deduplicates by entry identifier.
- Bad, because the gear retains every entry for the retention floor, which is the
  dominant storage cost under the throughput profile.

### Aggregates only, with the per-entry read paths removed

The gear serves one number per meter, period and grouping. The feed, the raw
query path and point lookup all go away.

- Good, because it is the smallest surface the gear can publish. One read shape,
  with no cursor, no watermark and no snapshot obligation.
- Good, because it makes the expensive scan unnecessary. Nothing has to stream
  tens of billions of entries out of the store.
- Good, because it matches how a dashboard actually consumes usage. A chart asks
  for a total per bucket and never for the entries behind it.
- Good, because storage falls to the rollup, so the retention floor stops driving
  resident data volume.
- Bad, because the entry stream is the deliverable a rating consumer needs. A
  charge must be reproducible and attributable to identified entries, and a total
  is neither.
- Bad, because no surveyed system that feeds a billing pipeline serves aggregates
  alone. The surveyed systems that serve totals are billing engines one layer
  above, and they own rating themselves.
- Bad, because the one surveyed system that does discard entries after
  aggregating is a monitoring store. It carries no correction primitive, no
  per-entry identity and no downstream billing hand-off.
- Bad, because it removes the correction evidence together with the entries. An
  invalidation entry and its reason code then have nowhere to be read.
- Bad, because it deletes point lookup, which is what lets a correction name its
  target and an auditor resolve one identifier.

### Raw query polling as the feed

A consumer polls the raw query path with a forward cursor over event time and
treats the pages as its stream.

- Good, because it adds no surface. The raw path exists for audit and already
  returns cursor-paginated pages.
- Good, because it serves entries as persisted, with correction linkage in both
  directions.
- Bad, because a raw scan cannot offer the snapshot guarantee. The consistency
  floor allows an entry seen on one page to be absent from a later one.
- Bad, because event time is emitter-supplied, bounded only by the live path's
  past tolerance and by the backfill window. An entry can be inserted behind a
  cursor that has already passed its position.
- Bad, because that hole exists on a fully converged single node. It is not
  replica lag, so no plugin consistency ceiling closes it.
- Bad, because the consumer cannot detect the omission. A silently incomplete
  charge run is the worst outcome the gear can hand downstream.

### Push through the event broker

The gear publishes every accepted entry to the platform event broker, and a
charging consumer subscribes.

- Good, because a consumer receives entries without polling, and end-to-end lag
  falls to broker latency.
- Good, because fan-out to several consumers costs the gear little beyond the
  publication itself.
- Bad, because a downstream outage couples into ingestion. A broker that stops
  accepting publications either blocks acceptance or drops entries the ledger has
  already acknowledged.
- Bad, because the consumer does not own the cursor. An overlapping replay is
  harmless only where the consumer chooses where to resume, and a broker offset
  is the broker's state.
- Bad, because replay past the retention floor cannot be refused with an
  actionable error. Broker retention becomes a second horizon, independent of the
  one the gear publishes.
- Bad, because it introduces a broker dependency the gear otherwise does not
  carry. DESIGN declares event architecture not applicable in v1.

## More Information

### What the analog survey shows

Every surveyed system that meters and then hands off to a rating layer hands off
entries. Google Service Control accepts reported operations, deduplicates them by
operation identifier, and exposes operations rather than totals. Azure metered
billing takes usage events per resource and dimension, and leaves pricing to the
marketplace. Amberflo and m3ter both roll up internally and then export records
to a billing system.

The systems that serve aggregates as their product sit one layer above. They own
rating themselves, so a period total is their deliverable rather than an
intermediate value someone else must reproduce. Only one surveyed system discards
entries after aggregating, and it is a monitoring time-series store with no
correction primitive and no billing hand-off.

The evidence is directional rather than decisive, and one point of dissent
belongs on the record. One surveyed engine runs analytical queries straight over
raw events and pre-aggregates nothing. It does so on a columnar engine, which the
launch storage plugin is not. That is why materialisation stays legitimate here,
and why it stays confined to the derived path.

### Why effectively-once belongs to the consumer

The split costs the consumer real work. It reads a stream instead of one number
per period. It holds a cursor and applies the declared fold on its own side. It
excludes both entries of a withdrawn pair as it folds, since the feed delivers
each of them at its own position. It also deduplicates on the entry identifier
rather than relying on the gear. The gear's dedup identity is bounded by
retention, so a submission that arrives after that identity ages out can be
admitted as a new entry.

That work belongs to the consumer, because only the consumer knows what it has
already charged for. The gear holds no record of a rated charge and owns no
billing period, so it cannot make the judgment at all. Placing effectively-once
at the consumer keeps the gear's own obligation to at-least-once delivery with a
stable identifier, which it can honour under replay.
