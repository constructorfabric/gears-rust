## 1. Architecture Overview

### 1.1 Architectural Vision

The Usage Collector is the platform's **append-only metering ledger**. It accepts attributed measurements over covered periods and never rewrites
one. It serves them back on three surfaces. These are an in-process SDK trait, a
Plugin SPI for storage backends, and a REST API for remote callers.

Three properties shape everything below. **The ledger is append-only.** A correction is an appended invalidation entry,
not an edit or a status flip. No read path can therefore observe a delivered
entry change. **Typing is not owned here.** GTS type declarations live in `types-registry`.
This gear resolves and validates against them through a local cache, and holds
no catalog of its own.
**The fold is declared, not chosen.** Each meter's aggregation is a property
of its declaration. One period therefore yields one number per meter, and the
aggregate request carries no aggregation parameter.

The architecture is contract-first and fail-closed. Authentication is owned by
the ToolKit gateway upstream. Authorization is anchored at the platform PDP
(`authz-resolver`). Persistence is reached only through the Plugin SPI. No
business logic — pricing, rating, billing, quota decisions — lives inside the
collector.

### 1.2 Architecture Drivers

#### Functional Drivers

| Requirement | Design Response |
| --- | --- |
| `cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-ingestion` | REST, SDK, and backfill entry points funnel into one Ingestion Gateway. The gateway authenticates upstream and authorizes at the PDP before dispatch. |
| `cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-idempotency` | Idempotency key mandatory on every entry. The dedup identity is the 5-tuple `(tenant, gts_type, key, window_start, window_end)`. Exact-equality retries are absorbed, divergent same-key writes surface as a fail-closed conflict. The horizon is the type's retention policy, measured from the covered period. |
| `cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-record-identity` | `id` is a deterministic UUIDv5 over the same 5-tuple, so it is stable, server-derived, and reproducible offline by the emitter before submission. `entry_type` is deliberately excluded from the derivation. |
| `cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-usage-windows` | The covered period `[window_start, window_end)` is the only emitter-supplied time attribution. `accepted_at` and `acceptance_sequence` are server-assigned. The gear stamps `accepted_at`, and the storage plugin assigns `acceptance_sequence` strictly monotonic per `(tenant_id, gts_type_id)`. Query selection reads the period end — `from <= window_end < to` — on every path, so no entry needs a shape-dependent case. |
| `cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-live-future-time-bound` | The live path bounds the covered period on both sides. It rejects a period that ends further into the future than a tolerance, 5 minutes by default. It also rejects one that starts further into the past than a second tolerance, 48 hours by default and configurable. Anything older must use the dedicated backfill route, which the rejection names. Both bounds govern every entry the path admits, an invalidation included, over the period it copies. The backfill path carries its own window. All of these are configuration, enforced in the Ingestion Gateway before dispatch. |
| `cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-record-quantity` | A finite signed decimal carried as `rust_decimal::Decimal`, wire-encoded as a JSON string, persisted in an exact decimal type. The published range and precision are declared in the OpenAPI contract. The SPI obliges every plugin to round-trip both halves without loss. |
| `cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-quantity-semantics` | The relation between quantity and period is carried by the declared fold and resolved per read. The gear never integrates, differentiates, interpolates, re-windows, or synthesizes samples. |
| `cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-aggregation-fold` | The fold is read from the resolved declaration, never inferred from the identifier and never accepted as a request parameter. The Query Gateway serves the declared fold and no other. |
| `cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-metering-unit-binding` | The unit is a declaration property resolved through the type reference. Ingestion rejects an entry whose type binds no unit. Never carried per entry. |
| `cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-canonical-units` | The canonical list is published in the OpenAPI contract. No path converts, scales, or rounds a quantity. |
| `cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-record-metadata` | Closed-shape validation against the declaration's schema at the gateway, with a configurable size cap. Declared properties are exactly the groupable and filterable dimensions, computed per request. |
| `cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-record-invalidation` | Invalidation rides the ordinary ingestion path as a faithful copy of its target with three closed departures. The Ingestion Gateway enforces the copy, the reference, no-invalidation-of-invalidation, and at-most-one-per-record before persistence. The copied period is bounded by the path, not by the entry kind. |
| `cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-invalidation-reason-code` | A non-empty reason code is mandatory on an invalidation and forbidden on an ordinary record. Returned on every read path exposing the correction. |
| `cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-usage-type-declaration` | No Usage Collector surface carries a type write operation. Declaration is a `types-registry` operation. |
| `cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-usage-type-resolution` | A dedicated Type Resolver component resolves declarations from `types-registry` through a local cache, fail-closed, on both write and read paths. Cached declarations stay usable during a registry outage. A declaration the registry has lost is restored from the mirror table of [§3.7](#37-database-schemas--tables), where a row exists and the registry returns a definite not-found answer. |
| `cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-tenant-attribution` | Tenant is mandatory and caller-supplied. The gateway performs a defence-in-depth check. The PDP authorizes the caller against the supplied tenant before dispatch. |
| `cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-resource-attribution` | `resource_id` and `resource_type` are mandatory, structurally validated, and part of the PDP attribution tuple. |
| `cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-subject-attribution` | Subject is optional and caller-supplied. When present the PDP authorizes against it. The core never derives subject identity from `SecurityContext`. |
| `cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-tenant-isolation` | Enforced through the PDP-returned scope on every read and write. The core checks each write's attribution against that scope. It applies the same scope as a filter to each query, before dispatch. |
| `cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-ingestion-authorization` | Every entry is authorized against its full attribution tuple, and its type is resolved, both before any plugin write. Failures fail closed immediately. |
| `cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-pluggable-storage` | A dedicated Plugin SPI covers persistence, query, and feed reads. The active backend is resolved lazily via Plugin Host and `types-registry`. `[usage_collector].vendor` selects the plugin identity at `Gear::init`. |
| `cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-query-aggregation` | The Query Gateway enforces the mandatory single-type and time-range filters, runs PDP authorization, and pushes the declared fold and grouping to the plugin. Withdrawn pairs are excluded from the selected set. |
| `cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-query-raw` | Raw query reuses the same authorization and constraint-application pattern and returns cursor-paginated pages. Withdrawn pairs are returned **as persisted**, with linkage in both directions. |
| `cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-billing-usage-feed` | A dedicated Feed Gateway serves per-subscription, cursor-paginated, snapshot-consistent pages ordered by `acceptance_sequence` within each `(tenant, gts_type)` scope, each carrying a watermark. |
| `cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-billing-fields-on-read` | Every read path returns the identifier, type reference, covered period, acceptance instant, declared metadata, signed quantity, entry type, bidirectional correction linkage with reason code, and origin marker — unstripped. |
| `cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-billing-retention-floor` | Retention is declared per type, and the plugin reads it from `types-registry` itself. No gear surface carries it. The floor — backfill window plus one replay horizon — is a plugin-readiness condition surfaced at review, not a gear-side sweep. |
| `cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-backfill` | A dedicated import path, workload-isolated from live ingestion, applying identical validation and stamping `origin = backfill`. Beyond the configured window it requires elevated authorization. It takes **Usage Records** and invalidation entries alike, on REST and on the SDK trait. |
| `cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-rate-limiting` | Configurable per-caller and per-(caller, tenant) ingestion quotas across all ingestion paths, rejecting over-quota submissions with an actionable throttle error carrying retry guidance. |
| `cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-reconciliation-metadata` | Per-scope counters and three watermarks — acceptance instant, covered-period end, acceptance sequence — exposed on REST at the three mandated granularities. The gear evaluates none of them. |
| `cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-data-classification` | Opaque identifiers, operational telemetry, and caller-supplied metadata are the three classes. The gear interprets none of them and hosts no PII resolution. |

#### NFR Allocation

| NFR ID | NFR Summary | Allocated To | Design Response | Verification |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `cpt-cf-usage-collector-nfr-ingestion-latency` | p95 ≤ 200 ms | Ingestion Gateway, Type Resolver, Plugin Host | One PDP decision and one cached type resolution cover each entry. No registry round-trip in the steady state. Budget split in [§3.11.2](#3112-latency-budgets-perf-design-003). | Load test at the throughput-profile envelope. |
| `cpt-cf-usage-collector-nfr-throughput` | ≥ 10,000 entries/sec | Ingestion Gateway, Plugin SPI | Batch ingestion is a first-class SPI method so each plugin drives its native bulk-write path. | Sustained-rate load test. |
| `cpt-cf-usage-collector-nfr-throughput-profile` | Sustained / burst / concurrency envelope | whole gear | Stateless gear replicas behind the platform gateway. Capacity is plugin-bound. | Envelope load test. |
| `cpt-cf-usage-collector-nfr-query-latency` | p95 ≤ 500 ms | Query Gateway, Plugin SPI | Fold and grouping are pushed down. The gear never iterates rows. | Aggregated-query load test. |
| `cpt-cf-usage-collector-nfr-workload-isolation` | Query load must not degrade ingestion | Plugin SPI, active plugin | Isolated backend pools are a plugin-deployment obligation. The backfill path is isolated from live ingestion at the gear. | Concurrent load test. |
| `cpt-cf-usage-collector-nfr-availability` | 99.95% monthly | whole gear | Stateless replicas. Fail-closed on dependency loss rather than degraded acceptance. | Availability budget burn. |
| `cpt-cf-usage-collector-nfr-query-freshness` | Floor-and-ceiling consistency contract | [§3.10](#310-consistency-contract) | Gear publishes the floor. Each plugin publishes its ceiling. Type declarations are explicitly **outside** the floor — their propagation is a property of the resolver cache. | Review of this design and the SPI consistency profile. |
| `cpt-cf-usage-collector-nfr-aggregate-freshness` | Plugin readiness gate, p95 ≤ 5 min where acted on | active plugin | The aggregate path is a derived view, so materialisation is legitimate. The plugin publishes its lag **and** its invalidation-propagation bound separately. | Plugin release-readiness review. |
| `cpt-cf-usage-collector-nfr-billing-feed-freshness` | Plugin readiness gate, p95 ≤ 5 min acceptance → feed | Feed Gateway, active plugin | A deployment whose plugin publishes no qualifying ceiling must not feed a charging consumer. | Plugin release-readiness review. |
| `cpt-cf-usage-collector-nfr-replay-throughput` | 24 h backlog cleared within 6 h | Feed Gateway, active plugin | Subscription scoping bounds the obligation to the meters a consumer actually reads. Required read rate ≥ subscribed arrival rate × (1 + backlog age / recovery time). | Recovery test against the subscription under test. |
| `cpt-cf-usage-collector-nfr-plugin-contract-stability` | Major-version stability per surface, from 1.0 onward | all three surfaces | Independent versioning, additive-only within a major, one prior major supported. | Contract diff gate, from 1.0 onward. |
| `cpt-cf-usage-collector-nfr-operational-visibility` | Dashboards and alert routing | [§3.11.5](#3115-operational-metric-inventory-ops-design-002) | Instrument inventory covers ingestion, query, PDP, plugin readiness, **and type-resolution failure and cache staleness**. | Dashboard and alert review. |

#### Key ADRs

| ADR ID | Decision Summary | Status against this design |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `cpt-cf-usage-collector-adr-pdp-centric-authorization` | Every operation is authorized at the platform PDP. The gear keeps no access table and no decision cache. | Current. |
| `cpt-cf-usage-collector-adr-pluggable-storage` | Persistence and query are reached only through the Plugin SPI. The operator selects the backend, and the host binds it lazily. | Current. |
| `cpt-cf-usage-collector-adr-caller-supplied-attribution` | Attribution is caller-supplied and PDP-authorized. The gear never derives tenant, resource, or subject from the caller's identity. | Current. |
| `cpt-cf-usage-collector-adr-mandatory-idempotency` | Every entry carries an idempotency key. The gear absorbs an exact-equality retry and rejects any divergent canonical field fail-closed. | Current. |
| `cpt-cf-usage-collector-adr-contract-stability` | REST, SDK, and Plugin SPI version independently. From 1.0 onward, only additive changes ship within a major, and one prior major stays supported. | Current. |
| `cpt-cf-usage-collector-adr-consistency-contract` | Floor-and-ceiling split. The gear publishes an eventual floor with no upper bound, and each plugin publishes its own ceiling. | Current. |
| `cpt-cf-usage-collector-adr-record-identity-derivation` | The identifier is a UUIDv5 over the dedup identity, which is tenant, type, key, and both covered-period bounds. | Current. |
| `cpt-cf-usage-collector-adr-registry-owned-typing` | `types-registry` owns every type declaration. The gear resolves through a cache, holds no catalog, and fails closed on an unresolvable reference. | Current, amended by `cpt-cf-usage-collector-adr-declaration-rehydration` for the recovery mirror. |
| `cpt-cf-usage-collector-adr-declared-fold` | Each type declares one immutable fold from `SUM`, `COUNT`, `MAX`, `MIN`, `LATEST`. The aggregate request carries no aggregation parameter. | Current. |
| `cpt-cf-usage-collector-adr-append-only-invalidation` | Invalidation is the single correction primitive. A faithful-copy invalidation entry travels the ordinary ingestion path and withdraws exactly one entry. | Current. |
| `cpt-cf-usage-collector-adr-feed-aggregate-split` | A charging consumer reads the entry feed. The aggregate path is a derived view a plugin may materialise. | Current. |
| `cpt-cf-usage-collector-adr-backfill-isolation` | Historical import runs on a dedicated origin-marked route, isolated from live ingestion. The path bounds the covered period, so a withdrawal of closed history travels the same route as an import. | Current. |
| `cpt-cf-usage-collector-adr-quantity-precision` | A quantity is an exact signed decimal in a published range. Every plugin round-trips that full range, including its negative half. | Current. |
| `cpt-cf-usage-collector-adr-window-end-selection` | A time range selects an entry by the end of its covered period. One predicate replaces interval overlap and its point-event case. | Current. |
| `cpt-cf-usage-collector-adr-declaration-rehydration` | The gateway mirrors each declaration it resolves and restores one the registry has lost. The plugin reads declared retention from `types-registry` itself. | Current. The mirror and the restore are **temporary** and retire when `types-registry` gets persistent storage. The retention rule is permanent. |

## 2. Principles & Constraints

### 2.1 Design Principles

#### Append-only ledger

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-principle-append-only-ledger`

An accepted entry is never rewritten, retired, or altered, and no operation on
any surface mutates one. There is no status field and no lifecycle flag. A correction is an appended invalidation entry. It is a faithful copy of its
target, with three closed departures: its own idempotency key, the target
reference, and a reason code. The reference is itself the discriminator — there
is no separate marker a caller could set inconsistently with it. Withdrawal takes effect **in the fold**. Aggregations exclude both entries of
the pair. Ledger read paths return both as persisted, with linkage in both
directions.

This is what keeps the feed's snapshot guarantee intact. A status flip on a
delivered row would be a mutation a paginated scan could observe. An appended
entry arriving at its own acceptance position cannot be.

**ADRs**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-adr-append-only-invalidation`

#### Registry-owned typing

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-principle-registry-owned-typing`

GTS type declarations are held by `types-registry`. The Usage Collector mints
none, exposes no registration or deletion surface, and maintains no second
catalog that would have to be kept in step. It resolves declarations through a local cache and validates entries against
them, fail-closed. An unresolvable reference is rejected rather than admitted
unvalidated. A registry outage degrades the introduction of new types rather
than the ingestion of existing ones.

Three attributes give a persisted entry its meaning: fold, unit, and metadata
surface. All three are immutable in the declaration. That immutability makes
read-time resolution safe, so the gear need not pin them at acceptance.

**ADRs**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-adr-registry-owned-typing`

#### Declared fold

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-principle-declared-fold`

Each meter declares exactly one aggregation fold, and the aggregate path serves
that fold and no other. A caller cannot choose one. The aggregate request therefore carries no
aggregation parameter, and no class of request is well-formed and semantically
wrong. The ingestion path never consults the fold:
no ingestion invariant depends on it, and the sign of a quantity is never
constrained.

**ADRs**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-adr-declared-fold`

#### PDP-centric authorization

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-principle-pdp-centric-authorization`

All read and write operations are authorized through the platform PDP
(`authz-resolver`). The check runs against the caller's `SecurityContext`,
which
carries the calling-gear identity, and against the operation's full
attribution tuple (tenant, resource, GTS type, and optionally subject). The gear neither caches PDP
decisions nor maintains its own access table. The PDP-returned scope defines the
authorization boundary. On a write, the gear checks the entry's attribution
against that scope. On a query, the same scope becomes a filter, applied before
any user-supplied filter narrows the result set.

**ADRs**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-adr-pdp-centric-authorization`,
`cpt-cf-usage-collector-adr-caller-supplied-attribution`

#### Fail-closed behavior

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-principle-fail-closed`

Every missing-`SecurityContext`, authorization, type-resolution, validation, and
storage failure resolves to immediate rejection with a deterministic error.
There is no anonymous bypass, no cached PDP decision, no synthesized identity,
no invented storage binding, and no silent discard of denied emissions. The gear must not relax validation to protect ingestion availability. That
would convert an availability incident into silent data corruption, which
surfaces on an invoice weeks later.

**ADRs**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-adr-pdp-centric-authorization`

#### Idempotency-by-key

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-principle-idempotency-by-key`

Every entry carries a client-provided idempotency key. A same-identity
submission resolves into exactly one of two outcomes. An exact-equality retry
is silently deduplicated. Any divergent caller-supplied field, including a
metadata-only difference, is a fail-closed conflict rather than a silent drop.
The dedup identity is `(tenant, gts_type, key, window_start, window_end)`.
Submissions that differ in period are therefore distinct entries rather than
conflicts, and an emitter does not encode the period into the key. The key must
still distinguish what the identity omits — resource, subject, a second entry in
one period, and an invalidation from its target — and a retry must repeat its
submission's key exactly.

The horizon is **per-meter and bounded**. An identity stays visible for at
least as long as the type's retention policy keeps the entry, measured from
the covered period. That span is a floor: beyond it a matching submission is
admitted as a new entry, deduplicated, or rejected as a conflict, by whether the
plugin has purged the earlier entry. A charging consumer's exactly-once property
rests on its own deduplication by entry identifier.

**ADRs**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-adr-mandatory-idempotency`,
`cpt-cf-usage-collector-adr-record-identity-derivation`

#### Pluggable storage

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-principle-pluggable-storage`

Persistence and query are reached exclusively through the Plugin SPI. The
active backend is resolved lazily on the first dispatch after `types-registry`
is consistent. `[usage_collector].vendor`, read once at
`Gear::init`, selects the plugin identity. The core couples to no backend SQL dialect,
schema, or client library.

**ADRs**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-adr-pluggable-storage`

#### Plugin resolution via ClientHub

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-principle-plugin-resolution-via-client-hub`

Storage-plugin binding is resolved through the platform's `PluginV1<P>` GTS base
type, `types-registry`, and `ClientHub` scoped registration. Each plugin's
`init()` publishes a `PluginV1<UsageCollectorPluginSpecV1>` instance and
registers a scoped `dyn UsageCollectorPluginV1` client. The host's
`GtsPluginSelector` resolves the bound instance by schema id plus configured
vendor (lowest priority wins) and caches it for the `Service`'s lifetime.
Plugins are compiled in at the workspace level. The host crate has no
compile-time dependency on any concrete plugin crate. The trait shape is in
[§3.3](#33-api-contracts).

**ADRs**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-adr-pluggable-storage`

#### Contract stability

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-principle-contract-stability`

The three public surfaces version independently under a major-version
stability contract. The contract starts at the 1.0 release of each surface.
From then on, only additive changes ship within a major, and at most one prior
major stays supported. Plugin authors, in-process consumers, and remote callers
therefore migrate on independent schedules.

**ADRs**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-adr-contract-stability`

#### Cursor gateway ownership

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-principle-cursor-gateway-ownership`

The gateway owns, issues, decodes, and validates every opaque continuation token
(`toolkit_odata::CursorV1`), on both the raw-query and feed paths. Plugins never
mint, encode, or interpret a wire cursor — they receive a structured tuple and
return rows plus a last keyset. This keeps cursor versioning, signing posture,
and validation at one platform-owned location.

**ADRs**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-adr-feed-aggregate-split`

#### Canonical error envelope

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-principle-canonical-errors`

The REST surface emits errors using `toolkit_canonical_errors::Problem` plus the
platform's registered standard-errors set. The gear defines no bespoke `Problem`
schema. `Problem.context` is a GTS-typed payload selected by the discriminator
in `context.reason`.

#### Canonical page envelope

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-principle-canonical-page`

Raw-read and feed responses use the canonical `toolkit_odata::Page` envelope. The gear defines no bespoke paging schema. Aggregated reads return a
non-paginated typed body.

#### Aggregate asymmetry

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-principle-aggregate-asymmetry`

The collector exposes read shapes that intentionally differ. Raw and feed reads
are cursor-paginated list endpoints. The aggregate is a body-shaped RPC
returning a non-paginated result set. Toolkit's OData layer does not expose `$apply`. The aggregate response is
bounded by `group_by` cardinality rather than row volume. Pagination would
therefore add complexity without recovering safety.

**ADRs**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-adr-feed-aggregate-split`

#### OTLP push emission

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-principle-otlp-push-emission`

Operational telemetry is pushed via OTLP from ToolKit's global
`SdkMeterProvider`. Instruments are constructed via
`opentelemetry::global::meter_with_scope("usage_collector", …)` at bootstrap.

### 2.2 Constraints

#### Plugin contract stability (major-version)

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-constraint-plugin-contract-stability`

From the 1.0 release of the Plugin SPI onward, a plugin built against version
`N` must keep working unchanged across every `N.x` release. A breaking change
ships as a new major that coexists with the prior major for one migration
window. This constrains plugin-facing type evolution to additive changes within
a major.

The three public surfaces — REST, SDK trait, and Plugin SPI — version
independently. Each Rust trait encodes its major version in the `V1` name
suffix. **Additive** means a new method carrying a default implementation, a
new optional input field, or a new non-required output variant. Removing or
renaming anything, narrowing accepted values, changing semantics, adding a
required input, or dropping a `default` implementation is **breaking**. Adding
an aggregation fold is additive. Removing one is breaking. A plugin that meets
a fold it does not implement returns `Internal(detail)` rather than
substituting another. Anything scheduled for removal is marked `deprecated` in
the rustdoc at least one minor release before the major bump. These rules bind
from 1.0, which no surface has reached: until then a breaking change ships in
place.

**ADRs**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-adr-pluggable-storage`,
`cpt-cf-usage-collector-adr-contract-stability`

#### No business logic in collector

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-constraint-no-business-logic`

Pricing, rating, billing rules, invoice generation, and quota decisions are out
of scope. The gear persists and serves usage only. Commercial identity is not carried. It covers subscription, SKU, and the payer
and seller axes. An emitter cannot know it, and downstream consumers resolve
it from tenant and resource attribution.

#### No type catalog in collector

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-constraint-no-type-catalog`

The gear must not hold a GTS type catalog, expose a type write surface, or
persist declaration attributes onto entries. Denormalizing fold, unit, or
metadata surface onto a high-rate stream would create a second place the same
fact can be read and disagree. This constrains the wire contract (no type write
endpoints), the SPI (no catalog methods), and the entity model (declaration
attributes resolved, never stored).

**ADRs**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-adr-registry-owned-typing`

#### NFR thresholds (from PRD §6)

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-constraint-nfr-thresholds`

The architecture must meet four PRD §6 thresholds at the same time, against
the throughput-profile envelope:

- ingestion p95 ≤ 200 ms at ≥ 10,000 entries/sec sustained
- aggregation p95 ≤ 500 ms over a 30-day single-tenant range
- ingestion p95 unaffected by concurrent query load
- 99.95% monthly availability

These constrain plugin selection, workload isolation, and capacity planning at
every deployment.

#### PII handled by identity layer (not collector)

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-constraint-pii-identity-layer`

Subject and tenant identifiers are opaque platform identifiers. PII management
belongs to the platform identity layer. The gear does not interpret, redact, or
classify them.

Per-bullet applicability for downstream privacy controls:

- **Consent management**: not applicable — platform identity layer.
- **Data-subject requests (DSR / GDPR / CCPA)**: not applicable — platform
  identity and legal/governance layers, and the active plugin's purge
  mechanism. **Invalidation is not an erasure path**: it withdraws a
  measurement from the fold while both entries stay persisted and readable.
- **Privacy Impact Assessment**: not applicable given the
  opaque-identifier-only data model.
- **Cross-border data transfer**: follows the bound plugin's deployment region.

**ADRs**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-adr-caller-supplied-attribution`

#### Vendor and licensing pluggability

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-constraint-vendor-pluggable`

No storage-vendor lock-in inside the gear. Persistence and query must be reached
exclusively through the Plugin SPI. The core must contain no backend-specific
SQL, schema, client libraries, or licensing assumptions. Any change introducing
a vendor-specific dependency requires a Plugin SPI major-version revision.

## 3. Technical Architecture

### 3.1 Domain Model

**Technology**: Rust types in `usage-collector-sdk/src/models.rs`. A
`gts_type_id` references a type declaration that `types-registry` owns.

**Location**:

- wire shapes — [`usage-collector-v1.yaml`](usage-collector-v1.yaml)
- GTS base type every meter derives from —
  [`schemas/usage_record.v1.schema.json`](schemas/usage_record.v1.schema.json)
- worked derivation —
  [`schemas/example.stored_volume.v1.schema.json`](schemas/example.stored_volume.v1.schema.json)

#### Modeling conventions

- Field names are snake_case. A Rust implementation can wrap a field in a
  newtype or an enum. It MUST keep the semantics stated here.
- `tenant_id`, `resource_id`, `subject_id`, and `gts_type_id` are opaque
  platform identifiers. The gear stores and compares them. It does not parse
  them or derive identity from them.
- All timestamps are UTC instants. A timestamp with no offset is rejected. A
  non-UTC offset is normalized to UTC.
- A quantity is a measurement, not money
  (§2.2 `cpt-cf-usage-collector-constraint-no-business-logic`).
- The ledger holds **entries**. An entry that carries `invalidates` is an
  *invalidation entry*. An entry that does not is a *usage record*. Both use
  the one persisted shape below.

**Core Entities**:

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-model`

| Entity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `UsageRecord` | One accepted entry on the append-only ledger. It carries the attribution tuple, the covered period, a signed quantity, the dedup key, the acceptance instant and sequence, the origin, and optional metadata. An invalidation entry adds the target reference and a reason code. No operation rewrites an accepted entry. |
| `CreateUsageRecord` | The identity-free ingestion shape that both entry types share. It is the only input shape on every ingestion path, live and backfill. It carries no `entry_type`: `invalidates` alone decides the kind. |
| `EntryType` | Closed discriminator, `record` or `invalidation`. Derived from the presence of `invalidates`. Never submitted, and never read from the value or sign of a quantity. |
| `RecordOrigin` | Closed marker, `live` or `backfill`. The Ingestion Gateway stamps it from the path the entry arrived on. It applies to invalidation entries too. |
| `ResourceRef` | Caller-supplied `(resource_id, resource_type)`. Both leaves are mandatory on every entry. The gear validates presence and shape only. Ownership is a PDP decision. |
| `SubjectRef` | Caller-supplied `(subject_id, optional subject_type)`. Absent for system-level consumption. `subject_type` cannot appear without `subject_id`. |
| `AggregationFold` | Closed set — `SUM`, `COUNT`, `MAX`, `MIN`, `LATEST`. Declared per GTS type, immutable, and read on the aggregate path only. `SUM` is the only fold that yields a chargeable period quantity. |
| `IdempotencyKey` | Caller-supplied opaque string, required on every entry. One component of the five-part dedup identity. |
| `RecordMetadata` | Closed-shape key/value map. The GTS type declares the admissible keys. Values are strings in v1. The size cap is per deployment. |
| `SecurityContext` | `toolkit_security::SecurityContext`, the platform-authenticated caller context. Declared in `libs/toolkit-security`, which is the only normative statement of its shape. Input to authorization only. |
| `UsageRecordFilterField` | The admissible `$filter` and `group_by` field set: `tenant_id`, `resource_id`, `resource_type`, `subject_id`, `subject_type`, `entry_type`, `origin`, and `invalidates`, plus the queried type's declared metadata keys. Resolved per request. |
| `Keyset` | The typed last-row sort tuple behind an opaque cursor. Raw reads use `(window_end, id)`. Feed reads use `(acceptance_sequence, id)`. |
| `AggregationResult` | Grouped buckets. Each carries the dimension values in `group_by` order and the folded quantity as `bigdecimal::BigDecimal` — unbounded, and deliberately not the per-entry `rust_decimal::Decimal`, because a fold is not bounded by the per-entry ceiling. `null` where no entry matched. Neither the fold nor the queried type rides the result: both are inputs to the call. |
| `FeedSubscription` | The set of GTS types one consumer reads. It bounds that consumer's pages, cursor, and watermark. |
| `FeedPage` | Entries in acceptance order, an opaque cursor, and a watermark that holds for every subscribed scope. |
| `ReconciliationMetadata` | Per-scope accepted counts, a fold-appropriate quantity summary, and three watermarks: acceptance instant, covered-period end, and sequence. |
| *(GTS type declaration)* | **Not an entity of this gear**, and given no shape here. A meter *is* a derived GTS type of `gts.cf.core.uc.usage_record.v1~`, whose trait schema is the only normative statement of what a declaration carries. The gear resolves a declaration. It never owns, mints, or stores one. |

**Field ownership.** Who sets each field is load-bearing: a caller cannot forge
identity, arrival order, or the entry kind.

| Group | Fields | Set by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Caller-supplied | `tenant_id`, `resource_ref`, `subject_ref`, `gts_type_id`, `quantity`, `window_start`, `window_end`, `idempotency_key`, `invalidates`, `reason_code`, `metadata` | the emitter, on `CreateUsageRecord` |
| Server-assigned | `id`, `accepted_at`, `origin` | the Ingestion Gateway, at the single choke point |
| Server-assigned | `acceptance_sequence` | the storage plugin, at persist |
| Derived on read | `entry_type`, `invalidated_by` | computed per read, never stored as a flag |

**Relationships**:

- `UsageRecord` → GTS type: references a registry-owned declaration by
  `gts_type_id`. The fold, the unit, the metadata surface, and the retention
  resolve through it and are never copied onto the entry.
- `UsageRecord` → `UsageRecord`: an invalidation entry withdraws exactly one
  record through `invalidates`. Reads return the linkage in both directions.
  The reverse direction, `invalidated_by`, is derived.
- `UsageRecord` → `ResourceRef` / `SubjectRef` / `RecordMetadata`: the
  attribution composites and the per-type extension surface.
- `FeedSubscription` → `FeedPage`: bounds which entries, cursor, and watermark
  one consumer receives.

#### Value Objects and Invariants

Read attributes of a resolved declaration — `aggregation_fold`,
`canonical_unit`, `metadata_schema`, `retention`, and
`nominal_sampling_interval` — are defined by the base type's trait schema. The
gear reads them and does not restate their admissible values. It MUST NOT act
on `nominal_sampling_interval`.

| Value object / Invariant | Definition | Enforced by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `MeterTypeId` | A GTS identifier derived from the base `gts.cf.core.uc.usage_record.v1~`. An identifier outside that base is rejected. | Type Resolver |
| Dedup identity | `(tenant_id, gts_type_id, idempotency_key, window_start, window_end)`. `resource_ref` and `subject_ref` are compared on a collision but are not part of it. One key shared across two resources over one period is therefore a conflict. | plugin uniqueness constraint |
| Identity derivation | `id` is the UUIDv5 over the dedup identity. `invalidates` is deliberately excluded, so one key cannot stand for both a measurement and its withdrawal. | Ingestion Gateway |
| Collision resolution | A collision on the full identity resolves by exact equality of the caller-supplied fields. All equal, the entry is silently deduplicated. Any field differing, including metadata alone, is rejected as a conflict. A second write is never silently dropped. | Ingestion Gateway + plugin |
| Idempotency horizon | A dedup identity stays visible for at least the declared retention of its type, measured from the covered period. That span is a guaranteed floor. Beyond it a matching submission is admitted as a new entry with the same derived `id`, deduplicated, or rejected as a conflict, by whether the plugin has purged the earlier entry. Detecting a repetition is the consumer's obligation. | plugin retention (§3.10) |
| Append-only invariant | No surface modifies an accepted entry. A correction is an appended invalidation entry. There is no status column, no lifecycle flag, and no row to rewrite. | absence of a mutation operation on REST, SDK, and SPI |
| Point-event invariant | `window_start <= window_end`. Equal bounds mark a point event, not an error. | Ingestion Gateway |
| Period-end selection | Every range selects an entry when `from <= window_end < to`, whatever the length of the period. No path matches by overlap or by containment, and no path reads `window_start` to select. | Query Gateway + every plugin (§3.3 contract test) |
| Quantity fidelity | A quantity read back equals the quantity submitted, digit for digit. No conversion, scaling, rounding, or truncation on any path. The published range is magnitude ≤ 7.9×10^28 with up to 28 significant decimal digits and at most 28 digits after the decimal point, negative half included. Wire-encoded as a JSON string, never a float, because a `SUM` fold MUST be bit-exact. | plugin exact-decimal storage (§3.3 contract test) |
| Faithful copy | An invalidation entry repeats every caller-supplied field of its target and departs in exactly three: its own idempotency key, `invalidates`, and `reason_code`. For `subject_ref`, presence against absence is a mismatch. A rejection names the field that differs. | Ingestion Gateway |
| Echo, not compensation | The copied quantity restates what is withdrawn. It is never negated or adjusted, and no signed compensating entry exists on any surface. | Ingestion Gateway |
| Both-or-neither | `invalidates` and `reason_code` appear together or not at all. An entry carrying neither is an ordinary record, whatever its other fields. | wire schema + Ingestion Gateway |
| At most one invalidation | A record carries at most one accepted invalidation. Two concurrent attempts resolve to exactly one. | plugin, atomically against the store |
| No invalidation of an invalidation | The target MUST itself be a record, carrying no `invalidates` of its own. | Ingestion Gateway |
| Permanence | An accepted invalidation has no reversal. A correction to a mis-measured quantity is an invalidation, then a fresh emission under a new key with the same attribution and period. | absence of a reversal operation |
| Withdrawal exclusion | Inside any fold, a withdrawn record and its invalidation each contribute nothing. Both carry one period end, so no range selects one without the other. Ledger read paths return both, as persisted. | Query Gateway + every plugin (§3.3 contract test) |
| Recomputation | A materialised aggregate MUST recompute over the affected range. A further term cannot reverse `MAX`, `MIN`, or `LATEST`. Append-only is a property of the ledger, not of a derived view. | plugin |
| Additivity | A consumer reading entries directly sums quantities only where the declared fold is `SUM`, and MUST leave out every withdrawn pair. Under any other fold the quantities are observations and summing them is invalid. | consumer contract |
| `COUNT` quantity | Under `COUNT` the quantity means nothing: one record is one event. An emitter sends `1`. Ingestion does not enforce this, because it never consults the fold. | consumer contract |
| `LATEST` tie-break | Greatest `window_end`, then greatest `acceptance_sequence`. It terminates because the sequence is monotonic inside the group's scope. `MAX` and `MIN` need no such rule. | plugin (§3.3 contract test) |
| Acceptance-sequence monotonicity | Strictly monotonic per `(tenant_id, gts_type_id)`. No cross-tenant or cross-type total order is claimed. This is what makes feed order deterministic and `LATEST` tie-breaking terminate. | plugin, at persist |
| Declaration immutability | The fold, the canonical unit, and the metadata surface are immutable for the life of a GTS type. A meter that must change one is a new type. A persisted quantity carries neither unit nor fold of its own, so an edit in place would silently restate every entry already accepted. | `types-registry` |
| Fail-closed resolution | An entry whose `gts_type_id` resolves nowhere is rejected and not persisted. The gear never substitutes a default for a declared attribute, and never relaxes validation to protect ingestion availability. Steady-state resolution is served from a local cache, so a registry outage degrades new-type introduction rather than ingestion. A declaration the registry has lost is restored from the mirror table (§3.7), where a row exists and the registry returns a definite not-found answer. | Type Resolver |
| Closed metadata shape | An undeclared key is rejected before persistence. There is no free-form remainder and no open-extras escape hatch. Admissibility is recomputed per request, so a freshly declared property is usable on the next request. | Ingestion Gateway + Query Gateway |
| Filter-surface reservation | `gts_type_id` is reserved: it travels as a typed parameter, and any predicate touching it is rejected. The covered period is likewise not filterable — the time range is a first-class parameter. Fixed-field identifiers accept `eq` and `in` only. | Query Gateway |
| Attribution independence | The gear never derives `tenant_id`, `resource_ref`, or `subject_ref` from `SecurityContext`. `SecurityContext.subject_id` describes the **caller**. `SubjectRef.subject_id` describes the **attributed subject**. The two names collide and the values are unrelated. | §3.9.6 |
| Scope intersection | The compiled PDP scope bounds a read. User filters narrow inside it and never widen it. | §3.9.6 |
| Plugin-owned lifecycle | Retention, backup, archival, purging, and query acceleration are plugin-owned. Two obligations bind them: the retention floor a charging-consumer meter carries, and that a purge never frees a dedup identity earlier than its horizon. A purge later than the horizon is permitted, which is why the horizon is a floor rather than an exact boundary. | plugin deployment guide (§3.10) |
| Additive schema evolution | REST, SDK, and Plugin SPI shapes can add optional fields within a major version. Removing a field or changing semantics requires a major-version break. | §2.2 `constraint-plugin-contract-stability` |

### 3.2 Component Model

The Usage Collector runs in a single process. That process holds a REST
surface, four domain components (Ingestion Gateway, Query Gateway, Feed
Gateway, Type Resolver), and a Plugin Host that lazily binds the active
backend. Boundaries
are drawn by responsibility, not deployment artifact. PDP enforcement is
cross-cutting — see [PDP Authorization Posture](#pdp-authorization-posture-cross-cutting-no-separate-component).

There is **no deactivation handler** and **no usage-type catalog component**:
invalidation rides the Ingestion Gateway, and typing is resolved from
`types-registry` by the Type Resolver.

#### Ingestion Gateway

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-component-ingestion-gateway`

##### Why this component exists

Centralizes the synchronous write path. Every submission flows through one
place, whether it arrives on REST or the SDK, live or backfill, single or
batched, record or invalidation. That place validates attribution, authorizes
the caller, and validates against the resolved declaration. It then derives
identity, enforces the invalidation rules, and dispatches to the active
plugin.

##### Responsibility scope

- Validates the structural attribution tuple (tenant, resource, optional
  subject, `gts_type_id`).
- Requires an idempotency key on every entry and derives `id` as the
  deterministic UUIDv5 over the 5-tuple.
- Validates the covered period: `window_start <= window_end`, UTC normalization,
  rejection of offset-less timestamps, and the live path's two-sided time bound.
  That bound rejects a period ending further into the future than the configured
  future tolerance. It also rejects one starting further into the past than the
  configured past tolerance, and that rejection names the backfill route. Both
  bounds apply to every entry, an invalidation included, over the period it
  copies.
- Validates the quantity against the published range and precision.
- Resolves the declaration through the Type Resolver and validates the metadata
  against its closed schema and the configurable size cap. Rejects an entry
  whose type binds no unit.
- **Enforces the invalidation rules.** These are the faithful copy of every
caller-supplied field, the target reference that marks the entry as a
withdrawal, and a resolvable target with `entry_type = record`. They also
include at most one invalidation per record and the mandatory reason code. The
copied period is bounded by period validation above, not by a rule of its own.
- Applies per-caller and per-(caller, tenant) ingestion quotas, rejecting
  over-quota submissions with an actionable throttle error carrying retry
  guidance.
- Stamps `accepted_at` and `origin`, and surfaces deterministic per-entry
  acknowledgements.

##### Responsibility boundaries

Does NOT persist directly — delegates to the Plugin Host. Does NOT consult the
declared fold: no ingestion invariant depends on it. Does NOT register, amend,
or withdraw declarations. Does NOT interpret metadata content. Does NOT define
authorization policy or authenticate callers. Does NOT mutate any accepted
entry. Fails closed on any dependency unavailability.

The backfill path is the same component under workload isolation: identical
validation, its own window and elevated-authorization rule in place of the live
past tolerance, and `origin = backfill`. It takes invalidation entries as well
as **Usage Records**, and is reachable on REST and on the SDK trait.

##### Related components (by ID)

- `cpt-cf-usage-collector-contract-authz-resolver` — per-entry PDP
  authorization. Covers `fr-ingestion-authorization`, `fr-tenant-attribution`,
  `fr-resource-attribution`, `fr-subject-attribution`.
- `cpt-cf-usage-collector-component-type-resolver` — resolves the declaration
  per entry. Covers `fr-usage-type-resolution`, `fr-metering-unit-binding`,
  `fr-record-metadata`.
- `cpt-cf-usage-collector-component-plugin-host` — dispatches each accepted
  entry. Covers `fr-ingestion`, `fr-idempotency`, `fr-record-invalidation`,
  `fr-backfill`.

#### Type Resolver

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-component-type-resolver`

##### Why this component exists

Resolution sits on the ingestion hot path, and `types-registry` publishes no
latency obligation of its own. A per-entry registry call would make this gear's
ingestion NFRs contingent on a second gear's availability and latency. A local cache of resolved declarations keeps those obligations self-contained.
For that reason it is a design-level component rather than an implementation
detail.

##### Responsibility scope

- Resolves a `gts_type_id` to its registered declaration, serving the steady
  state from cache.
- Exposes the declaration's fold, canonical unit, metadata schema, and nominal
  sampling interval to the write and read paths. It does not serve the declared
  retention. The storage plugin reads that from `types-registry` itself
  ([§3.3](#33-api-contracts)).
- Maintains the cache: population on miss, refresh, and staleness accounting.
  Because declarations are immutable in fold, unit, and metadata surface, a
  cached entry cannot silently change meaning. Only additions and withdrawals
  propagate.
- Mirrors each declaration it resolves, and restores one that `types-registry`
  has lost. On a cache miss the registry answers, and the resolver writes the
  row and serves. Where the registry answers not found and a row exists, the
  resolver registers the stored document back and serves. Where neither has it,
  resolution fails closed as before. A failed mirror write is counted and does
  not reject the entry. The restore needs a definite not-found answer. Where
  the registry answers with an error instead, the resolver cannot tell a
  forgotten declaration from an unavailable one, and a cold cache fails closed
  although the row exists. `cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-usage-type-resolution`
  carries that case, and the failed-mirror-write case, as stated limits on its
  guarantee. Temporary, per
  `cpt-cf-usage-collector-adr-declaration-rehydration`.

##### Responsibility boundaries

Does NOT mint, amend, or withdraw declarations — those are `types-registry`
operations. A restore re-registers the same document the registry accepted
before, so it introduces no declaration the platform has not already seen.
Does NOT substitute a default for any declared attribute. Does NOT relax validation to protect availability. An unresolvable reference
is rejected fail-closed. Where a declaration no longer resolves, and either no
mirror row holds it or the registry gave no definite not-found answer, every
operation that depends on resolving it is rejected. The rejection lasts for as
long as the
identifier does not resolve. Entries already accepted under that
declaration remain persisted and unmodified.

##### Related components (by ID)

- `cpt-cf-usage-collector-contract-types-registry` — the declaration system of
  record. Consulted on cache miss.
- `cpt-cf-usage-collector-component-ingestion-gateway`,
  `cpt-cf-usage-collector-component-query-gateway` — consume resolved
  declarations.

#### Query Gateway

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-component-query-gateway`

##### Why this component exists

Serves the read side — aggregated and raw — through one component owning query
authorization, filter composition, and dispatch. Centralizing it keeps PDP
constraint application uniform across SDK and REST and prevents user filters
from widening the authorized scope.

##### Responsibility scope

- **Aggregation**: mandatory time range and single type. Optional attribution
  filters and grouping. Serves the **declared fold** resolved from the
  declaration, pushed down to the plugin. Excludes every withdrawn pair from
  the selected set.
- **Raw**: mandatory time range and single type. Optional filters. Cursor-paginated over `(window_end, id)`. Returns withdrawn pairs **as
  persisted** with bidirectional linkage.
- **Point lookup** by entry identifier, returning the exact persisted fact.

All three paths do the same four things. They select on the period end. They
validate that every named
filter or grouping dimension is either a fixed field or a property the
resolved schema declares. They run PDP authorization and compose the returned
constraints with user filters, so the result can only narrow. They then
dispatch through the Plugin Host.

##### Responsibility boundaries

Does NOT accept an aggregation parameter. Does NOT apply a fold on the raw path.
Does NOT mint or interpret storage-level cursors beyond the gateway-owned
envelope. Does NOT evaluate watermarks or raise stall signals.

#### Feed Gateway

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-component-feed-gateway`

##### Why this component exists

A charging consumer's inbound path must be replay-safe under concurrent ingest —
a consumer outage beyond its buffer, a region loss, a bounded re-rating. Without
snapshot-consistent cursors a scan is silently incomplete or silently
duplicated. The feed is a distinct component from the Query Gateway for two reasons. It
orders by arrival rather than by covered period. Its snapshot and watermark
obligations also have no analogue on the query paths.

##### Responsibility scope

- Accepts a subscription declaring the GTS types a consumer reads, and excludes
  everything else from the pages, the cursor, and the watermark.
- Serves cursor-paginated pages ordered by `acceptance_sequence` within each
  `(tenant, gts_type)` scope. Interleaving of scopes within a page is
  implementation-defined but deterministic: the same cursor yields the same
  continuation, extended only by entries accepted since. A replay bounded by a
  recorded watermark is identical, entry for entry.
- Returns a watermark with every page, holding for every subscribed scope.
- Refuses a cursor older than the retention floor with an actionable error,
  rather than serving a silently truncated range.
- Serves corrections as ordinary entries at their own acceptance position. No
  feed entry represents a change to an already-delivered entry.

##### Responsibility boundaries

Does NOT apply a fold, filter withdrawn pairs, or remove either entry of a pair
from the stream. Does NOT push — the feed is pull-only. Does NOT evaluate
consumer progress or hold a stall threshold.

#### Plugin Host (ClientHub-bound)

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-component-plugin-host`

##### Why this component exists

Concentrates backend binding and dispatch so no domain component couples to a
concrete plugin. Binding is a runtime concern resolved through `types-registry`
and `ClientHub`. The host crate has no compile-time dependency on any plugin
crate.

##### Responsibility scope

Resolves the bound plugin instance lazily on first dispatch, through
`GtsPluginSelector`. It caches the resolved `GtsInstanceId` for the
`Service`'s lifetime, and performs a `ClientHub::try_get_scoped` lookup per
call.
Dispatches persistence, query, and feed operations, and classifies plugin errors
into the gear's error taxonomy.

##### Responsibility boundaries

Does NOT authorize, validate, or interpret domain content. Does NOT invent a
fallback binding or retain a prior one: `None` from `try_get_scoped` lifts to a
per-call unavailability error. Does NOT keep a parallel local persistence path
for use when no plugin is bound.

##### Binding invariants

- Exactly one active storage binding exists per configured GTS instance scope.
- The binding is not modelled as a state machine. It is recomputed on each call
  from two structural facts — the cached `GtsInstanceId` and the scoped
  `ClientHub` lookup — so there is no bound/unbound state to keep consistent.
- The SPI major version is encoded structurally in the `gts_schema_id` path
  suffix rather than carried as a runtime field. There is no version
  negotiation at dispatch.

#### PDP Authorization Posture (cross-cutting, no separate component)

PDP enforcement is not a component. Each domain component calls a shared
`access_scope_with` helper — a thin wrapper over
`PolicyEnforcer::access_scope_with` — inline, not as Tower or `OperationBuilder`
middleware. `OperationBuilder::authenticated()` performs bearer-auth resolution
and injects the `SecurityContext` extractor. Nothing beyond that runs at the
framework layer. REST handlers are thin pass-throughs. This keeps in-process and
REST callers on one authorization path.

A PDP permit is not the whole decision. The PDP returns the scope the caller may
act in. Each component then checks its operation's attribution against that
scope and denies anything outside it. This post-permit check is part of the
authorization, not an extra safeguard.

### 3.3 API Contracts

The Usage Collector exposes three public surfaces, each versioned
independently. `usage-collector-v1.yaml` is the authoritative machine-readable
REST contract. The two Rust surfaces are declared below and are canonical in
`usage-collector-sdk/src/` once implemented.

**No surface carries a GTS type write operation.** Declaring, amending, and
withdrawing declarations are `types-registry` surfaces
(`cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-usage-type-declaration`).

Rules that hold on both Rust surfaces:

1. The trait implementation — not the REST handler, not middleware — is the
   single site for authorization, validation, and dispatch. Each method runs, in
   order: the PDP call, composition of the compiled scope against caller
   filters, GTS type resolution, plugin dispatch, then the plugin-error lift.
2. The fold is never a parameter. A caller cannot select one.
3. Neither surface exposes a catalog operation or a mutation operation. Both
   absences are load-bearing: see §2.2 `constraint-no-type-catalog` and the §3.1
   append-only invariant.
4. Cursors are opaque. The gateway mints, decodes, and validates
   `toolkit_odata::CursorV1`. A caller threads back what it read.
5. `AggregationQuery` and `RawQuery` are parameter tuples, not structs. The
   time range is a typed parameter and never a `$filter` conjunct.
6. `MetadataFilter` is the dynamic-key side channel, because the
   `toolkit-odata` grammar does not express filters over JSON map keys. AND
   across distinct keys, OR within one key's values, empty slice means no

#### SDK Trait — `cpt-cf-usage-collector-interface-sdk-client`

- **Contracts**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-contract-downstream-usage-reader`
- **Technology**: In-process async Rust trait, registered in ClientHub without scope
- **Location**: `usage-collector-sdk/src/api.rs`
- **Allocated To**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-component-ingestion-gateway`, `cpt-cf-usage-collector-component-query-gateway`, `cpt-cf-usage-collector-component-feed-gateway`

Covers ingestion of both entry types on the live and the backfill path
(`fr-ingestion`, `fr-idempotency`, `fr-record-invalidation`, `fr-backfill`),
raw query (`fr-query-raw`), aggregated query (`fr-query-aggregation`), point
lookup (`fr-record-identity`), and the usage feed (`fr-billing-usage-feed`).
Backfill is on the trait because it is the only route reaching past the live
past tolerance. An in-process emitter needs that route to import history and to
withdraw it. Operator operations — quota configuration and reconciliation
metadata — are REST-only.

```rust
#[async_trait]
pub trait UsageCollectorClientV1: Send + Sync + 'static {
    /// Ingest one ledger entry — a measurement or an invalidation.
    ///
    /// `id` is derived from the dedup identity, never supplied. An
    /// exact-equality retry returns the persisted entry. Any difference
    /// under the same identity is `Conflict(IdempotencyConflict)`.
    async fn create_usage_record(
        &self,
        ctx: &SecurityContext,
        record: CreateUsageRecord,

    ) -> Result<UsageRecord, UsageCollectorError>;

    /// Aggregated query over one meter and one range.
    ///

        ctx: &SecurityContext,
        gts_type_id: MeterTypeId,
        time_range: TimeRange,
        query: &ODataQuery,
        metadata_filter: &[MetadataFilter],
    ) -> Result<ODataPage<UsageRecord>, UsageCollectorError>;

    /// Replay-safe feed page over `(acceptance_sequence, id)`.

    async fn read_usage_feed(
        &self,
        ctx: &SecurityContext,
        subscription: &FeedSubscription,
        cursor: Option<&CursorV1>,
        limit: Option<u64>,
    ) -> Result<FeedPage, UsageCollectorError>;
}
```

#### Plugin SPI — `cpt-cf-usage-collector-interface-plugin`

- **Contracts**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-contract-storage-plugin`
- **Technology**: Async Rust SPI trait, registered in ClientHub with GTS instance scope
- **Location**: `usage-collector-sdk/src/plugin_api.rs`
- **Allocated To**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-component-plugin-host`

One `usage-collector-plugin-<backend>` crate per backend implements this trait
under `plugins/<backend>/`. Each depends on `usage-collector-sdk` only, never
on the host crate. Registration, discovery, and vendor selection follow the
platform pattern in [TOOLKIT_PLUGINS.md](../../../../docs/TOOLKIT_PLUGINS.md).
The GTS spec is `usage-collector-sdk/src/gts.rs`. There is no readiness probe
and no flush. Availability is the conjunction of a cached selector and a
resolvable scoped client. A plugin that buffers writes drains them on its own
`Gear::shutdown`.

```rust
#[async_trait]
pub trait UsageCollectorPluginV1: Send + Sync + 'static {
    /// Persist one ledger entry (record or invalidation).
    async fn create_usage_record(
        &self,
        record: UsageRecord,
    ) -> Result<UsageRecord, UsageCollectorPluginError>;

    /// Persist a batch. Outcomes align with input order.
    async fn create_usage_records(
        &self,
        records: Vec<UsageRecord>,
    ) -> Result<Vec<Result<UsageRecord, UsageCollectorPluginError>>, UsageCollectorPluginError>;

    /// Read one entry by identifier, with its correction linkage.
    async fn get_usage_record(&self, id: Uuid) -> Result<UsageRecord, UsageCollectorPluginError>;

    /// Compute the given fold over the authorized scope.
    ///
    /// The fold arrives as a parameter: declarations never reach the SPI.
    async fn query_aggregated_usage_records(
        &self,
        gts_type_id: MeterTypeId,
        time_range: TimeRange,
        fold: AggregationFold,
        query: &ODataQuery,
        metadata_filter: &[MetadataFilter],
        group_by: &[AggregationDimension],
    ) -> Result<AggregationResult, UsageCollectorPluginError>;

    /// Keyset-paginated ledger read over `(window_end, id)`.
    async fn list_usage_records(
        &self,
        gts_type_id: MeterTypeId,
        time_range: TimeRange,
        query: &ODataQuery,
        metadata_filter: &[MetadataFilter],
    ) -> Result<ODataPage<UsageRecord>, UsageCollectorPluginError>;

    /// Snapshot-consistent feed page over `(acceptance_sequence, id)`.
    async fn read_feed_page(
        &self,
        subscription: &[MeterTypeId],
        page_after: Option<FeedKeyset>,
        limit: u64,
    ) -> Result<FeedPage, UsageCollectorPluginError>;

    /// Per-scope ingestion counters and watermarks.
    async fn get_reconciliation_metadata(
        &self,
        scope: ReconciliationScope,
    ) -> Result<Vec<ReconciliationMetadata>, UsageCollectorPluginError>;
}
```

**Plugin obligations.** These sit on top of the §3.1 invariants a plugin
enforces (period-end selection, quantity fidelity, dedup identity, at most one
invalidation, sequence monotonicity, `LATEST` tie-break, recomputation):

- **Do not re-validate.** The gateway enforces PDP attribution, type
  resolution, declaration validation, metadata shape, quantity range, period
  ordering, quotas, and every invalidation rule before dispatch. A malformed
  call that reaches the SPI is a host-contract breach and returns
  `Internal(detail)`.
- **Treat every filter as authoritative.** PDP constraints are already
  intersected with user filters. A plugin MUST NOT widen a result set.
- **Do not read a declaration.** Retention is the one permitted registry read,
  because the plugin applies it. Metadata filters lower to the backend's
  JSON-path facility and are ANDed onto the OData-derived `WHERE`.
- **No business logic.** A plugin stores signed quantities and reports folds.
  A negative `SUM` is an ordinary outcome.
- **Offset/limit scans are forbidden** on both paginated paths.
- **Trace context is ambient.** Continue the Plugin Host's span over the
  backend dispatch.
- **Latency sub-allocations** (§3.11.2): 75 ms p95 of the 200 ms ingestion
  budget, 425 ms p95 of the 500 ms aggregated-query budget. For batched
  ingestion, raw paging, feed reads, and reconciliation, reserve at least
  25 ms of the end-to-end envelope for gateway, PDP, and core overhead.
- **`AggregationBucket.key` encoding**: `tenant_id` as `Uuid::to_string()`
  (lowercase, hyphenated), every other dimension verbatim.

**Plugin contract tests.** Every conforming plugin MUST pass the suite in
`usage-collector-sdk`. The tests are behavioural and MUST pass on any backend.

| Test | Asserts |
| --- | --- |
| `window-end-selection` | A range selects by period end, exclusive at the upper bound. A point event needs no special case. An entry wider than the range is selected by neither side. |
| `invalidation-excluded-from-fold` | A withdrawn pair folds to nothing while both entries stay readable with the linkage in both directions. Excluding only the record double-counts the withdrawn measurement. |
| `at-most-one-invalidation` | A second withdrawal of one record is rejected. Under two concurrent submissions exactly one succeeds. |
| `dedup-identity-over-window` | Both period bounds are part of the identity, so a same-key submission over a different period is a distinct entry. |
| `quantity-round-trip` | The full published range round-trips digit for digit, negative half included. |
| `feed-snapshot-and-replay` | A paginated scan observes no entry appearing, disappearing, or changing, except append-only arrivals the watermark demarcates. Replay from one cursor yields the same entries in the same order, extended only by entries accepted since. Bounded by a recorded watermark, the replay is identical. |
| `latest-tie-break` | Greatest `window_end`, then greatest `acceptance_sequence`. |

#### REST API — `cpt-cf-usage-collector-interface-rest-api`

- **Contracts**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-contract-downstream-usage-reader`
- **Technology**: HTTP REST + OpenAPI 3 (major version in the URL prefix)
- **Location**: [`usage-collector-v1.yaml`](usage-collector-v1.yaml)
- **Allocated To**: all four domain components

The full product operation surface, served behind the platform API gateway.
Authentication is owned by the ToolKit gateway upstream. PDP authorization is
on the critical path of every operation, with no anonymous bypass and no cached
decisions. The production OAS is emitted at runtime by `OpenApiRegistryImpl`,
and a CI drift-check diffs it against `usage-collector-v1.yaml`.

#### Endpoints Overview

| Path | Method | OperationId | Tag |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `/usage-collector/v1/records` | `POST` | `usage_collector.create_usage_records` | `Usage Records` |
| `/usage-collector/v1/records` | `GET` | `usage_collector.list_usage_records` | `Usage Records` |
| `/usage-collector/v1/records/{id}` | `GET` | `usage_collector.get_usage_record` | `Usage Records` |
| `/usage-collector/v1/records/aggregate` | `POST` | `usage_collector.query_aggregated_usage_records` | `Usage Records` |
| `/usage-collector/v1/records/backfill` | `POST` | `usage_collector.backfill_usage_records` | `Backfill` |
| `/usage-collector/v1/feed` | `GET` | `usage_collector.read_usage_feed` | `Usage Feed` |
| `/usage-collector/v1/reconciliation` | `GET` | `usage_collector.get_reconciliation_metadata` | `Reconciliation` |

All data paths sit under `/usage-collector/v1/`. **OperationIds are
`usage_collector.<operation name>`**, and where an operation also exists on the
SDK trait the two names are identical — so a drift between the emitted OAS and
the trait is a one-token diff. The reconciliation endpoint is operator-only: it
has no trait counterpart and follows the same pattern. Single-entry ingestion
has no endpoint of its own. REST ingests through the batch route. Tags are
Title Case, drawn from `Usage Records`, `Backfill`, `Usage Feed`, and
`Reconciliation`. Liveness and readiness probes are handled by the ToolKit host
outside this gear. Request and response schemas, parameters, and capacity caps
are defined in `usage-collector-v1.yaml`.

**This gear exposes no usage-type endpoint at all.** Declarations are owned,
served, and listed by `types-registry`. The Type Resolver reads them for the
write and read paths and mirrors none of that onto this contract, per
`cpt-cf-usage-collector-constraint-no-type-catalog`.

**One ingestion path for both entry types.** `POST /records` accepts ordinary
records and invalidation entries alike, discriminated by the `invalidates`
reference the entry carries. There is no dedicated correction endpoint, SDK
method, or SPI call, and no endpoint modifies an accepted entry.
`POST /records/backfill` is the same contract under workload isolation,
stamping `origin = backfill`. Which of the two an entry belongs on follows from
its covered period alone, and an invalidation copies the period it withdraws.

#### Cursor & Pagination

Per `cpt-cf-usage-collector-principle-cursor-gateway-ownership`, the gateway
owns `toolkit_odata::CursorV1` on both paginated paths. The SPI never sees the
wire token. The two paths anchor on different keysets. Raw query uses
`(window_end, id)`, and the feed uses `(acceptance_sequence, id)`. One orders
the ledger by the column selection reads, the other by arrival. Each tuple is
unique within its scope, so successive page boundaries neither skip nor repeat
rows within a stable filter scope.

#### Error Contract

Both Rust surfaces return a flat `thiserror::Error` enum declared in
`usage-collector-sdk/src/error.rs`. The SDK crate does **not** depend on
`toolkit-canonical-errors`: consumers pattern-match variants directly, as they
do with `account-management-sdk`, `credstore-sdk`, and `authz-resolver-sdk`.
The host lifts `UsageCollectorError` onto
`toolkit_canonical_errors::CanonicalError` in
`usage-collector/src/infra/sdk_error_mapping.rs`, and `CanonicalError`'s
`IntoResponse` produces the RFC-9457 `Problem` envelope. The gear defines no
private HTTP-status table.

`UsageCollectorError` — the public consumer taxonomy. Discrimination inside a
category is a typed `reason` sub-enum, so a consumer matches the category, then
the reason. The reason vocabularies are declared in
`usage-collector-sdk/src/reason.rs` and carried on the wire in
`usage-collector-v1.yaml`. They are additive within a major version.

| Variant | AIP-193 category | HTTP | Raised for |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `PermissionDenied` | `PermissionDenied` | 403 | PDP denial. The by-id surface collapses denial to `NotFound`. |
| `InvalidArgument` | `InvalidArgument` | 400 | Structural and semantic validation. `reason: ValidationReason` rides `field_violations[0].reason`. |
| `NotFound` | `NotFound` | 404 | An unresolvable GTS type, a missing entry, an invalidation target that resolves to nothing, or a collapsed denial. |
| `Conflict` | `Aborted` | 409 | `reason: ConflictReason` rides `context.reason`. |
| `ResourceExhausted` | `ResourceExhausted` | 429 | Ingestion quota exceeded. Carries retry guidance. Entries are never silently dropped. |
| `ServiceUnavailable` | `Unavailable` | 503 | Transient infrastructure failure. The only infrastructure-retryable class. |
| `Internal` | `Internal` | 500 | Unclassified. `detail` MUST be DSN-free and redacted at the construction site. |

`is_retryable()` is true for `ServiceUnavailable` alone. `ResourceExhausted` is
retryable after the indicated delay and is reported separately, so a caller can
tell backpressure from infrastructure failure.

`UsageCollectorPluginError` — the SPI taxonomy, translated at the dispatch
boundary in `usage-collector/src/domain/service.rs`:

| `UsageCollectorPluginError` | Lifts to |
| --- | --- |
| `Transient(detail)` | `ServiceUnavailable` |
| `Internal(detail)` | `Internal` |
| `IdempotencyConflict { idempotency_key, existing_id }` | `Conflict(IdempotencyConflict)` |
| `AlreadyInvalidated { id, invalidated_by }` | `Conflict(AlreadyInvalidated)` |
| `UsageRecordNotFound { id }` | `NotFound` |
| `CursorBeyondRetention { oldest_available }` | `InvalidArgument(CursorBeyondRetention)` |

Six variants, deliberately. Type resolution, faithful-copy and reason-code
checks, metadata shape and size, quantity range, cursor decoding, and
authorization are all gateway-side. The SPI therefore carves no variant for any
of them. A plugin that observes one has observed a host-contract breach and
returns `Internal(detail)`. There is no `Unready` variant. A plugin can add
per-variant context fields as long as the classification and the
`error_category` metric mapping (§3.11.5) hold.

#### Startup-time plugin binding

The host binds to a concrete plugin once at startup through `types-registry`
and ClientHub, then caches the resolved instance for the `Service` lifetime.
Selection is exact on the configured `[usage_collector].vendor`, and ties break
on the lowest `PluginV1.priority`. Configuration changes take effect at gear
restart. There is no parallel cache and no retain-prior fallback. The host does
`try_get_scoped` per call. A miss lifts to a per-call plugin-unavailable error,
never to a substituted prior binding. Plugins are workspace members
linked at build time. The host crate has no compile-time dependency on any of
them, and no dynamic loading is involved.

### 3.4 Internal Dependencies

In-process platform gears consumed via SDK clients on ClientHub. Integration
detail lives in [§3.5](#35-external-dependencies). Call sites are visible in the
[§3.6](#36-interactions--sequences) sequences.

| Dependency Gear | Interface Used | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `authz-resolver` | SDK client (`PolicyEnforcer`) via ClientHub, realising `cpt-cf-usage-collector-contract-authz-resolver` | PDP permit/deny plus the constraint set it compiles into an `AccessScope`, for every ingestion, query, and feed operation. |
| `types-registry` | SDK client (`TypesRegistryClient`) via ClientHub, realising `cpt-cf-usage-collector-contract-types-registry` | **Two distinct uses**: resolving GTS type *declarations* on the ingestion and query paths, and resolving the configured GTS selector to the bound storage-plugin *instance*. |

The double role of `types-registry` is deliberate and worth naming. A
declaration outage degrades the introduction of new meters. A plugin-instance
outage degrades binding at startup. The two failure modes have
different blast radii and different mitigations (declaration cache versus cached
binding).

### 3.5 External Dependencies

#### Platform PDP

- **Contract**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-contract-authz-resolver`
- **Consumed by**: ingestion-gateway, query-gateway, feed-gateway (each via the shared per-component helper. No centralized adapter)

| Aspect | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| Direction | Consumed (Usage Collector → PDP) |
| Driver | `PolicyEnforcer::access_scope_with(ctx, …)` from `authz-resolver-sdk` |
| Data | `SecurityContext` plus attribution tuple (tenant, resource, optional subject, `gts_type_id`). Returns permit/deny plus the constraint set compiled into an `AccessScope` |
| Availability | Critical-path. Fail-closed on unreachable. No cached decisions, no permissive fallback. |
| Compatibility | Platform authorization protocol. Breaking changes require coordinated release |

#### Types Registry

- **Contract**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-contract-types-registry`
- **Consumed by**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-component-type-resolver` (declarations), `cpt-cf-usage-collector-component-plugin-host` (plugin instance)

| Aspect | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| Direction | Consumed (declaration resolution and plugin identity resolution) |
| Driver | `TypesRegistryClient`. Declarations by `gts_type_id`, plugin instances by `UsageCollectorPluginSpecV1::gts_schema_id()` plus configured vendor (lowest `PluginV1.priority` wins) |
| Data | GTS type declarations (fold, unit, metadata schema, retention, optional sampling interval). GTS instance identifiers |
| Availability | **Declarations**: steady state served from the resolver cache. Cached declarations remain usable while the registry is unreachable, so an outage degrades the introduction of new types rather than ingestion of existing ones. An unresolvable reference is rejected fail-closed. **Plugin instance**: lazy resolve on first dispatch. No matching instance ⇒ `PluginUnavailable`. An already-resolved binding tolerates transient unavailability. |
| Compatibility | Declaration shape and selector identifiers follow platform GTS protocol. Breaking changes require coordinated release |

#### Storage Plugin SPI

- **Contract**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-contract-storage-plugin`
- **Interface**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-interface-plugin`
- **Dispatched by**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-component-plugin-host` on behalf of all domain components

| Aspect | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| Direction | Provided (library SPI). Plugins ship on independent release schedules |
| Driver | Trait dispatch via `ClientHub::try_get_scoped::<dyn UsageCollectorPluginV1>` keyed by `ClientScope::gts_id(&instance_id)` |
| Data | Seven method contracts — persistence, point lookup, aggregated and raw query, feed page reads, and per-scope reconciliation metadata — are declared in [§3.3](#33-api-contracts). Reconciliation is REST-only for consumers but needs an SPI method because the gear is stateless: the counters and watermarks live in the plugin. |
| Availability | Plugin owns its SLO. Gateway dispatches per call — no parallel cache, no invented binding |
| Compatibility | Stable across minor/patch within a major. Breaking changes ship as a new major coexisting with the prior during a migration window |

#### Downstream Usage Reader

- **Contract**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-contract-downstream-usage-reader`
- **Served by**: query-gateway (record reads) and feed-gateway (feed reads)

| Aspect | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| Direction | Provided (read-only). **Pull-only by design** — no push/subscribe surface. |
| Driver | REST plus in-process SDK. Wire contract: §3.3 plus `usage-collector-v1.yaml`. |
| Data | Raw reads, aggregated reads, point lookups, and feed pages with cursor and watermark. Business logic must not run inside the Usage Collector. |
| Availability | `nfr-query-latency` plus `nfr-availability`. Feed freshness and replay throughput are plugin-readiness gates. PDP fail-closed. Readers must not invent usage state when UC is unreachable. |
| Compatibility | From 1.0 onward, at most one prior major of REST and SDK supported concurrently. |

**Dependency Rules** (per project conventions):

- No circular dependencies
- Always use SDK gears for inter-gear communication
- No cross-category sideways deps except through contracts
- Only integration/adapter gears talk to external systems
- `SecurityContext` must be propagated across all in-process calls

### 3.6 Interactions & Sequences

Every sequence below is synchronous request/response. `SecurityContext` is
resolved upstream by the ToolKit gateway and propagated on every in-process
call.

#### Emit Usage Record

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-seq-emit-usage`

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant S as Usage Source
    participant GW as ToolKit Gateway
    participant IG as Ingestion Gateway
    participant TR as Type Resolver
    participant PDP as authz-resolver
    participant PH as Plugin Host
    participant P as Storage Plugin

    S->>GW: POST /records (CreateUsageRecord[])
    GW->>IG: authenticated SecurityContext + payload
    IG->>IG: quota check (caller, tenant)
    IG->>PDP: access_scope_with(ctx, tenant, resource, subject?, gts_type_id)
    PDP-->>IG: permit | deny
    alt deny
        IG-->>GW: PermissionDenied (fail closed)
    end
    IG->>TR: resolve(gts_type_id)
    TR-->>IG: declaration (unit, metadata schema, retention) | unresolved
    alt unresolved
        IG-->>GW: NotFound naming the identifier (fail closed)
    end
    IG->>IG: validate period, quantity, metadata (closed shape), size cap
    IG->>IG: derive id = UUIDv5(tenant, gts_type, key, window_start, window_end)
    IG->>IG: stamp accepted_at, origin=live
    IG->>PH: create_usage_record(s)
    PH->>P: persist (assigns acceptance_sequence)
    P-->>PH: persisted | absorbed retry | IdempotencyConflict
    PH-->>IG: outcome
    IG-->>GW: per-entry acknowledgement
```

The fold is **not** consulted anywhere on this path. Batch submissions apply the
same steps per entry, with per-entry outcomes returned in input order.

#### Invalidate Usage Record

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-seq-invalidate-record`

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant S as Usage Source
    participant IG as Ingestion Gateway
    participant PDP as authz-resolver
    participant PH as Plugin Host
    participant P as Storage Plugin

    S->>IG: POST /records or /records/backfill (invalidates, reason_code)
    IG->>PDP: access_scope_with(ctx, attribution tuple)
    PDP-->>IG: permit | deny
    IG->>PH: get_usage_record(invalidates)
    PH->>P: read target
    P-->>PH: target | not found
    alt target missing or entry_type=invalidation
        IG-->>S: rejected (no invalidation of an invalidation)
    end
    IG->>IG: faithful-copy check on every caller-supplied field
    IG->>IG: covered-period bounds of the path the entry arrived on
    IG->>PH: create_usage_record (invalidation entry)
    PH->>P: persist, rejecting an already-invalidated target
    P-->>PH: persisted | AlreadyInvalidated | IdempotencyConflict
    PH-->>IG: outcome
    IG-->>S: acknowledgement
```

The entry travels the ordinary ingestion path: same PDP attribution, same
mandatory idempotency key, same quota machinery, and the same covered-period
bounds. It carries its own key, distinct from the target's. An entry submitted under
the target's key collides on all five dedup attributes. That entry is rejected
as a same-key content mismatch.

The period is the target's, so a withdrawal reaching past the live past
tolerance is rejected there and belongs on `/records/backfill`, which the
rejection names.

#### Query Aggregated Usage

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-seq-query-aggregated`

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Consumer
    participant QG as Query Gateway
    participant TR as Type Resolver
    participant PDP as authz-resolver
    participant PH as Plugin Host
    participant P as Storage Plugin

    C->>QG: POST /records/aggregate (gts_type_id, time_range, group_by?)
    QG->>PDP: access_scope_with(ctx, read scope)
    PDP-->>QG: permit + constraints | deny
    QG->>TR: resolve(gts_type_id)
    TR-->>QG: declaration (fold, metadata schema) | unresolved
    QG->>QG: validate grouping/filter fields against the declared schema
    QG->>QG: intersect authorized scope with user filters
    QG->>PH: query_aggregated_usage_records(gts_type_id, range, filters, group_by)
    PH->>P: push down declared fold + grouping, excluding withdrawn pairs
    P-->>PH: AggregationResult
    PH-->>QG: buckets
    QG-->>C: AggregationResult
```

The request carries **no aggregation parameter** — the fold comes from the
declaration. Time selection reads the period end.

#### Query Raw Usage Records

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-seq-query-raw`

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Consumer
    participant QG as Query Gateway
    participant TR as Type Resolver
    participant PDP as authz-resolver
    participant PH as Plugin Host
    participant P as Storage Plugin

Withdrawn pairs are returned as persisted. The path applies no fold, so it has
none to correct.

#### Read Usage Feed

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-seq-read-feed`

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Charging Consumer
    participant FG as Feed Gateway
    participant PDP as authz-resolver
    participant PH as Plugin Host
    participant P as Storage Plugin

    C->>FG: GET /feed (subscription: gts_type_ids[], cursor?)
    FG->>PDP: access_scope_with(ctx, read scope per subscribed type)
    PDP-->>FG: permit + constraints | deny
    FG->>FG: decode cursor, reject if older than the retention floor
    FG->>PH: read_feed_page(subscription, page_after, limit)

    PH-->>FG: page
    FG->>FG: attach linkage, mint next_cursor
    FG-->>C: FeedPage { entries, next_cursor, watermark }
```

Corrections arrive as ordinary entries at their own acceptance position. An accepted invalidation removes no entry from the feed. A replay from a
cursor within the retention floor therefore observes the same entries the
original scan observed.

#### Backfill Import

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-seq-backfill-import`

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant O as Operator / Importer
    participant IG as Ingestion Gateway (backfill path)
    participant PDP as authz-resolver
    participant PH as Plugin Host

    O->>IG: POST /records/backfill (CreateUsageRecord[])
    IG->>PDP: access_scope_with(ctx, attribution tuple)
    PDP-->>IG: permit | deny
    IG->>IG: window check, elevated authorization required beyond it
    IG->>IG: identical validation to the live path
    IG->>IG: stamp origin=backfill
    IG->>PH: create_usage_records (isolated workload)
    PH-->>IG: per-entry outcomes
    IG-->>O: per-entry acknowledgements
```

Validation is identical to the live path. Only the window rule, the origin
marker, and the workload isolation differ. The route takes invalidation entries
alongside **Usage Records**, under the same per-entry rules.

### 3.7 Database schemas & tables

The Usage Collector gateway owns one durable table, and it is temporary. The
single logical persistence anchor — the entry ledger — is wholly plugin-owned
and reached exclusively through `cpt-cf-usage-collector-interface-plugin`.

**There is no usage-type catalog table.** Declarations live in
`types-registry`, and the gear serves resolution from an in-memory cache that
is derived state with no durability obligation.

**There is a declaration mirror table**, holding one row per resolved GTS type:
the type identifier, the declaration document as registered, and first-seen and
last-seen timestamps. Declarations are platform-global, so it is not
tenant-scoped, and it holds one row per meter rather than per entry. Only the
Type Resolver reads it, only on the restore path. No entry references it and it
enforces no referential integrity. It exists because `types-registry` stores
declarations in memory, and it is dropped when that changes
(`cpt-cf-usage-collector-adr-declaration-rehydration`).

Concrete table shapes are plugin-internal per `DATA-DESIGN-NO-001`, and each
plugin's own DESIGN document owns them. These shapes cover column types,
primary keys, indexes, partitioning, retention, materialised views, and
acceleration structures. Two obligations bind them from here. The dedup identity must be enforced as a
uniqueness constraint over the 5-tuple, and preserved for the retention
horizon. The plugin assigns `acceptance_sequence` and must keep it strictly
monotonic per `(tenant_id, gts_type_id)`.

### 3.8 Deployment Topology

- [ ] `p3` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-topology-gear-runtime`

The gear runs behind the platform API gateway, horizontally scalable by replica
count. Entry state lives in the active storage plugin's backend, and
declaration state lives in `types-registry`. A replica holds its
resolved-declaration cache and its cached plugin binding, both reconstructible
on restart. The one durable table the gear owns is the declaration mirror of
[§3.7](#37-database-schemas--tables), shared across replicas, so a restore by
one replica serves all of them. Multi-region deployment is not a v1 capability.

### 3.9 Security Architecture

#### 3.9.1 Authentication Architecture (SEC-DESIGN-001)

Authentication is owned by the ToolKit gateway upstream of the gear, which
resolves and injects `SecurityContext`. The collector never resolves
credentials, never synthesizes an identity, and exposes no anonymous path.

#### 3.9.2 Data Protection (SEC-DESIGN-003)

The gear persists opaque platform identifiers, operational telemetry, and
caller-supplied metadata only. At-rest encryption, key management, masking, and
disposal are plugin-owned. Callers are contractually forbidden from placing PII,
payment data, regulated health data, or credentials into metadata.

#### 3.9.3 Security Boundaries (SEC-DESIGN-004)

Three boundaries: the platform gateway (authentication), the per-component PDP
call (authorization), and the Plugin SPI (persistence). No domain component
reaches a backend directly, and no surface admits an unauthorized entry.

#### 3.9.4 Threat Modeling (SEC-DESIGN-005)

| Threat | Mitigation |
| --- | --- |
| Cross-tenant attribution by an authorized caller | The PDP returns the caller's scope. The post-permit gate denies any entry whose attribution falls outside that scope. |
| Forged correction — withdrawing another caller's measurement | The invalidation carries the target's full attribution, and the same PDP check applies. A faithful-copy mismatch is rejected naming the field. |
| Quantity poisoning via non-finite or out-of-range values | Ingestion rejects absent, non-numeric, non-finite, or out-of-range quantities before persistence. |
| Existence oracle via point lookup | PDP denial on by-id surfaces collapses to `NotFound`, so a denied entry is indistinguishable from a missing one. |
| Ingestion flood from a misbehaving emitter | Per-caller and per-(caller, tenant) quotas reject over-quota submissions with an actionable throttle error rather than dropping silently. |
| Replay past the dedup horizon producing duplicate charges | The feed refuses a cursor older than the retention floor. Consumers deduplicate by entry identifier beyond the gear's horizon. |
| Supply-chain risk in a storage plugin | Plugins are workspace members reviewed under the gear's provenance checks. Binding is operator-configured, not caller-influenced. |

#### 3.9.5 Audit Architecture (SEC-DESIGN-006)

The v1 access trail is composed at the platform gateway and at the per-component
PDP decision points, correlated by the `correlation_id` the gear propagates
unchanged. The gear hosts no audit log of its own. Gear-side audit emission for
operator-write paths is deferred ([§3.12.2](#3122-known-technical-debt-and-runbook-maint-design-002-maint-design-003)).

#### 3.9.6 Authorization Architecture (SEC-DESIGN-002)

Every operation is authorized at the platform PDP against the caller's
`SecurityContext` and the operation's attribution tuple. Read decisions return
constraint filters that define the authorization boundary and are intersected
with user filters before dispatch, so a user filter can only narrow. No decision
is cached, and there is no gear-local access table.

The decision and constraint types are platform-owned: `authz-resolver` returns
`EvaluationResponse`, which the gear compiles into a
`toolkit_security::AccessScope` through `PolicyEnforcer::access_scope_with`.
What is domain-local is **which dimensions of an entry can be scoped at all**.
A PDP predicate addresses a column by property name, and the gear advertises
the names it can compile in the `supported_properties` of its `ResourceType`.
A constraint naming an unadvertised property fails to compile, and a read whose
constraints all fail to compile fails closed. Every advertised property maps to
a fixed field of `UsageRecordFilterField` (§3.1):

| PDP property | Filter field | Scope it authorizes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `owner_tenant_id` | `tenant_id` | The tenant an entry is attributed to. Carries `InTenantSubtree`, so nested tenants authorize a subtree rather than an enumerated set. |
| `resource_id`, `resource_type` | same | The attributed resource. |
| `subject_id`, `subject_type` | same | The attributed subject, where one is present. |
| `gts_type_id` | *(reserved)* | The meter. Scopable even though it is not user-filterable: the typed parameter stays the caller's only way to name a type, and PDP narrows independently of it. |

Deny decisions reject the operation before any state change or plugin read. A
read requires a permit **and** a non-empty compiled scope: an empty constraint
set is a fail-closed condition, not an unrestricted grant. A write requires a
permit **and** a returned scope that admits the full attribution tuple —
tenant, resource, referenced GTS type, and subject where supplied. An empty
constraint set fails closed on the write path too.

### 3.10 Consistency Contract

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-design-consistency-contract`

This section publishes the single plugin-agnostic consistency contract SDK,
REST, and feature consumers code against. It exists because `cpt-cf-usage-collector-nfr-workload-isolation` routes
ingestion and query to isolated backend pools. That isolation creates
queryability lag between the synchronous ack path and the subsequent read
paths. The decision is recorded in
`cpt-cf-usage-collector-adr-consistency-contract` and follows a
**floor-and-ceiling split**.

**Floor (gear-level, normative).**

- **Ingestion ack** — after an ingestion call returns the persisted entry, that
entry is durable. Its dedup identity stays visible to subsequent ingestion
attempts for as long as the referenced type's retention policy keeps it. The dedup
  window is therefore **per-meter and bounded**, not unbounded.
- **Read paths (raw, aggregate, point lookup, feed)** — **eventually consistent
  with no upper bound** relative to a same-tenant ingestion ack. The window is
  driven by the active plugin's replication topology, not by Usage Collector.
  **No monotonic-reads guarantee at the floor.** The floor is per
  `(tenant_id, gts_type_id)`. No cross-tenant or cross-type ordering is claimed.
- **Type declarations are outside this floor.** They are resolved from `types-registry` through the Type Resolver cache. Their
propagation delay is therefore a property of that resolution path rather than
of the storage plugin.

**Consumer rules (normative consequence).**

- **Read-after-write flows must not be designed on the query paths.** Admission
  control, post-emit summary, and immediate-readback dashboards must consume the
  ingestion ack, which is the only surface the floor binds for write-derived
  state.
- **Near-real-time observers poll within the query-latency NFR and tolerate
  lag.**
- **Defend against observed-then-disappeared** on the query paths: an entry seen
  in one page may be missing from a later page read against a different replica.
- **Raw tailing is best-effort, not a change feed.** `window_end` is
  emitter-supplied event time, and the live path accepts it back to the
  configured past tolerance while backfill accepts its whole window. An entry may
  therefore be inserted at a position a forward `(window_end, id)` cursor has
  already passed. This is orthogonal to replica lag — it occurs even on a
  fully-converged single node. **A consumer that must not miss entries reads the feed.** The feed orders by
  `acceptance_sequence` and therefore has no such hole. Such a consumer can
  also re-aggregate over a closed window.

**The feed is the exception, and deliberately so.** Unlike the query paths, the feed guarantees a **consistent snapshot**. A
paginated scan does not observe entries appearing, disappearing, or changing
mid-scan. The one exception is append-only arrivals, which the watermark
returned with each page demarcates. The append-only ledger purchases that guarantee. No entry is ever mutated, and
a correction arrives as a later entry rather than a change to a delivered one.
A scan therefore has nothing to observe changing. Feed *freshness* remains a
plugin-readiness gate (`nfr-billing-feed-freshness`). Feed *consistency* is a
gear-level guarantee.

**Plugin SPI floor parity.** The same floor binds the SPI. Nothing a plugin
does relaxes or strengthens it. Each plugin crate's deployment guide MUST
publish that plugin's actual consistency profile. A consumer needing a tighter
bound can then opt in by coupling to it. Every guide MUST state:

1. whether ingestion and query land on the same backend pool or on isolated
   pools, and the expected upper bound on query-path lag
2. **acceptance → feed visibility, p95.** A deployment whose plugin publishes
   no qualifying ceiling here MUST NOT feed a charging consumer
   (`nfr-billing-feed-freshness`, ≤ 5 minutes p95)
3. **acceptance → aggregate visibility**, where the aggregate is materialised,
   **and separately how an accepted invalidation reaches it**. Withdrawal
   obliges recomputation, so a single number for both overstates one of them
   (`nfr-aggregate-freshness`)
4. whether monotonic reads per `(tenant_id, gts_type_id)` hold by default, and
   which knobs preserve them
5. the retention it enforces per GTS type. The floor is the backfill window
   plus one replay horizon, and the retention must meet it for every type a
   charging consumer reads
6. the sustained bulk read rate it can serve the feed at, against
   `nfr-replay-throughput`, and the procedure for deploying outside the
   documented posture.

A consumer depending on a tighter bound than the gear floor couples itself to
one plugin's ceiling. That coupling MUST be recorded in the consumer's own
design document, so a plugin substitution surfaces as a known impact rather
than a latent regression. Weakening a published bound is a breaking change for
every coupled consumer. Profile discovery is documentation-only in v1: there is
no typed `consistency_profile()` method.

### 3.11 Performance and Operations Architecture

#### 3.11.1 Performance Patterns (PERF-DESIGN-001)

Three patterns carry the budgets. **Aggregation pushdown**: the fold and every
grouping dimension execute in the plugin's native acceleration structures. The
gear never iterates rows. **Declaration caching**: steady-state type resolution
is an in-memory lookup, so ingestion does not pay a registry round-trip.
**Batch ingestion**: a first-class SPI method so each plugin drives its native
bulk-write path.

#### 3.11.2 Latency Budgets (PERF-DESIGN-003)

Canonical NFR p95 budgets:

| Operation | NFR ID | Total p95 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ingestion | `cpt-cf-usage-collector-nfr-ingestion-latency` | 200 ms |
| Aggregated query (30-day single-tenant) | `cpt-cf-usage-collector-nfr-query-latency` | 500 ms |

SPI sub-allocations: **75 ms** of the ingestion budget and **425 ms** of the
aggregated-query budget. Per-component PDP enforcement dominates ingestion
latency. Aggregation pushdown dominates query latency. Type resolution adds no
round-trip in the steady state — a cache miss is a cold-path cost, not a budget
line. DESIGN carves no sub-allocation for batched ingestion, raw paging, or feed
reads. For those, plugins **SHOULD** reserve ≥ 25 ms of the end-to-end envelope for
gateway, PDP, and core overhead. Plugins must publish their own SPI-internal
budgets in their deployment guide.

#### 3.11.3 Resource Efficiency (PERF-DESIGN-004)

The gear holds no entry state and two bounded caches: resolved declarations
(bounded by the number of registered types) and the plugin binding (a single
identifier). Memory growth is therefore driven by in-flight request
concurrency, not by data volume. Storage growth is plugin-owned. The dominant
driver is per-entry metadata, bounded by the configurable size cap.

#### 3.11.4 Observability Architecture Applicability (OPS-DESIGN-002)

Instruments are constructed via `opentelemetry::global::meter_with_scope` at
bootstrap and exported through ToolKit's `SdkMeterProvider` over OTLP. W3C trace context (`traceparent` required, `tracestate` optional) propagates
on the ambient span. The Plugin Host opens that span around each dispatch, so
end-to-end traces span gateway → core → plugin → backend. Every accepted and rejected operation
emits a structured log entry carrying the propagated `correlation_id`.

#### 3.11.5 Operational Metric Inventory (OPS-DESIGN-002)

Instrument names are the full literal Prometheus names under a substitutable
`uc_` prefix. Histogram bucket layouts bracket the
[§3.11.2](#3112-latency-budgets-perf-design-003) budgets. Names, buckets, and
label vocabularies are part of the architectural contract.

##### Counters

| Instrument | Labels | Emitting component | Emitted when |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `uc_ingestion_requests_total` | `outcome` (`accepted`, `partial`, `rejected`), `error_category` (`none`, `missing_security_context`, `authz`, `unresolved_type`, `validation`, `metadata_size`, `quota`, `plugin_error`) | ingestion-gateway | Every submission request completes. `error_category` carries the request-wide reason and is `none` for `accepted`/`partial`. |
| `uc_ingestion_records_total` | `outcome` (`accepted`, `duplicate`, `rejected`), `entry_type` (`record`, `invalidation`), `origin` (`live`, `backfill`), `error_category` (`none`, `authz`, `unresolved_type`, `validation`, `idempotency_conflict`, `invalidation_rule`, `plugin_error`) | ingestion-gateway | One increment per entry. **This carries the throughput NFR** — the profile is stated in entries, not requests — plus the correction and backfill shares. A period-bound rejection is `validation` for either `entry_type`, since the bound belongs to the path; `invalidation_rule` covers the copy, reference and at-most-one rules alone. |
| `uc_query_requests_total` | `query_kind` (`aggregated`, `raw`, `point`), `outcome` (`success`, `denied`, `error`), `error_category` (`none`, `missing_security_context`, `authz`, `unresolved_type`, `cursor_decode`, `undeclared_field`, `missing_time_range`, `query_budget`, `plugin_error`) | query-gateway | Every query attempt completes. |
| `uc_feed_requests_total` | `outcome` (`success`, `denied`, `error`), `error_category` (`none`, `authz`, `cursor_decode`, `cursor_beyond_retention`, `plugin_error`) | feed-gateway | Every feed page request completes. `cursor_beyond_retention` is the replay-refusal signal. |
| `uc_type_resolution_total` | `result` (`cache_hit`, `cache_miss`, `restored`, `unresolved`, `registry_error`) | type-resolver | Every declaration resolution. The `cache_hit` share is the signal that the ingestion budget assumption holds. A sustained `restored` rate means `types-registry` is losing declarations. |
| `uc_declaration_mirror_write_failures_total` | — | type-resolver | A declaration resolved but not mirrored. Each one is a type that a later registry restart will not restore. Ingestion is unaffected. |
| `uc_pdp_failures_total` | `operation` (`ingest`, `backfill`, `query_raw`, `query_aggregated`, `get_record`, `read_feed`, `get_type`, `list_types`, `reconciliation`), `cause` (`unreachable`, `timeout`) | any component performing PDP enforcement | PDP call fails or times out. Denials are not failures. `cause="timeout"` is reserved until a host-side PDP deadline exists. |
| `uc_authz_decisions_total` | `operation` (same set), `decision` (`permit`, `deny`) | any component performing PDP enforcement | Every completed authorization records the **effective gear decision**: `permit` only when the PDP permits *and* the post-permit gate admits. Exactly one decision or one failure per authorization. |
| `uc_plugin_accept_errors_total` | `operation` (SPI method name), `error_category` (`unready`, `backend_error`, `timeout`) | plugin-host | Active plugin returns a classified error. |

##### Gauges

| Instrument | Labels | Emitting component | Update trigger |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `uc_plugin_ready` | — | plugin-host | `1` iff the selector has cached an instance id AND `try_get_scoped` returns `Some`. A structural check, not a plugin probe — the SPI exposes no `ready()`. |
| `uc_pdp_ready` | — | any PDP-enforcing component | `1` while the `authz-resolver` client is bound in the bootstrap-constructed `PolicyEnforcer`. A structural bootstrap fact. |
| `uc_query_inflight` | `query_kind` (`aggregated`, `raw`) | query-gateway | Incremented on entry once authorization composes. Feeds the workload-isolation alert. |
| `uc_resolved_types` | — | type-resolver | Current entry count of the resolved-declaration cache. **Per-instance** — aggregate with `max` or `last`, never `sum`. |
| `uc_declaration_cache_age_seconds` | — | type-resolver | Age of the oldest cached declaration since its last successful refresh. Backs the cache-staleness signal mandated by `nfr-operational-visibility`. |

##### Label cardinality

All labels are bounded to the enumerated sets above. Unbounded identifiers —
`tenant_id`, `resource_id`, `subject_id`, `gts_type_id`, `request_id`,
`trace_id`, idempotency keys — **must not** be used as metric labels. They
belong in structured logs and traces. `MetricsConfig.cardinality_limit` in the
`[opentelemetry]` block is the SDK-level safety net.

Plugins may expose backend-internal metrics under their own prefix. Those series
are owned by the plugin's deployment guide.

#### 3.11.6 Alerting and Error-Budget Architecture (OPS-DESIGN-004)

| Signal | NFR / Principle | Threshold | Backing metric(s) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Ingestion-latency breach | `nfr-ingestion-latency` | p95 > 200 ms over 5 min | `uc_ingestion_duration_seconds{origin="live"}` |
| Throughput cliff | `nfr-throughput-profile` | sustained drop ≥ 50% from trailing 1-hour baseline | rate(`uc_ingestion_records_total{outcome="accepted"}`) |
| Availability-budget burn | `nfr-availability` | ≥ 25% of monthly budget in any 24-hour window | `uc_plugin_ready` AND rate(`uc_plugin_accept_errors_total`) |
| Query-latency breach | `nfr-query-latency` | p95 > 500 ms over 15 min | `uc_query_duration_seconds{query_kind="aggregated"}` |
| Plugin-unready | `nfr-availability` | structural readiness fails ≥ 1 min | `uc_plugin_ready` |
| Workload-isolation breach | `nfr-workload-isolation` | ingestion p95 > 200 ms over ≥ 5 min while ≥ 100 aggregation queries are in flight | `uc_ingestion_duration_seconds` AND `uc_query_inflight{query_kind="aggregated"}` |
| PDP unavailability | `principle-fail-closed` | > 1% PDP failures over 5 min | rate(`uc_pdp_failures_total`) over total requests. Corroborated by `uc_pdp_ready` |
| **Type-resolution failure** | `fr-usage-type-resolution`, `nfr-operational-visibility` | `unresolved` + `registry_error` share > 1% over 5 min | rate(`uc_type_resolution_total{result=~"unresolved\|registry_error"}`) |
| **Declaration-cache staleness** | `nfr-operational-visibility` | oldest cached declaration exceeds the configured refresh interval by ≥ 2× | `uc_declaration_cache_age_seconds` |
| **Feed replay refusal** | `fr-billing-usage-feed` | any sustained occurrence over 15 min | rate(`uc_feed_requests_total{error_category="cursor_beyond_retention"}`) — a consumer is falling behind the retention floor |
| AuthZ deny-rate anomaly | `principle-fail-closed` | per-operation deny share ≥ 3× trailing 24-hour baseline over 15 min | `uc_authz_decisions_total{decision="deny"}` over total, per `operation` |

Error-budget governance: the 99.95% monthly availability budget yields ~21.6
minutes per month. Burn-rate alerting is realized over the OTLP-exported
metrics. Threshold tuning is owned by the platform observability and on-call
rotation.

### 3.12 Maintainability, Testing, UX, and Integration Architecture

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-design-maintainability-testing-ux-integration`

#### 3.12.1 Testing (TEST-DESIGN-001, TEST-DESIGN-002)

The Plugin SPI is the canonical testability seam: the core ingestion, query, and
feed paths run unchanged against an in-memory test plugin. The Type Resolver is the second seam. A fixture declaration set replaces
`types-registry`. That fixture makes fold, unit, and metadata-surface
behaviour testable without a live registry. The per-component PDP helper is the third. Test doubles are injected
via ClientHub and tests construct fixture `SecurityContext` values directly.

| Category | Scope | Environment / Tooling |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Unit | Identity derivation, idempotency, invalidation rules, period validation, constraint application, fold selection. | `cargo test`. Mock PDP, fixture declarations, in-memory plugin. |
| Integration | End-to-end through REST and SDK against an in-memory plugin, including feed pagination and replay. | Integration target in the gear crate. |
| E2E | Cross-gear: caller-gear → gateway → usage-collector → consumer, with a live `types-registry`. | `testing/e2e/`. |
| Performance | Sustained throughput, p95 latency, and the feed recovery objective. | Load generator. Representative active plugin. |
| Security | Unauthenticated calls, cross-tenant attribution, forged corrections, existence-oracle probes. | CI security gate plus review against [§3.9.4](#394-threat-modeling-sec-design-005). |
| Contract | OpenAPI diff (REST), Rust trait diff (SDK), SPI compatibility, and the SPI contract-test suite in [§3.3](#33-api-contracts). | Diff-on-PR gate. |

#### 3.12.2 Known Technical Debt and Runbook (MAINT-DESIGN-002, MAINT-DESIGN-003)

| Debt entry | Why deferred | Owner | Remediation target |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Implementation lags this design.** Both traits, `models.rs`, and the TimescaleDB plugin still implement counter/gauge, `corrects_id`, `status`, and a plugin-owned catalog. | This revision is docs-first by decision. The specs drive the code change rather than describing it. | usage-collector gear team | Next implementation cycle. |
| DECOMPOSITION and the feature specifications still describe the superseded model. | Quarantined in `artifacts.toml` pending this rewrite. | usage-collector gear team | After this design settles. |
| Gear-emitted audit events for operator-write paths. | v1 access trail is composed at the gateway and the PDP call. | usage-collector gear team | Once platform audit infrastructure stabilizes a gear-side contract. |

#### 3.12.3 Event Architecture and User Experience (INT-DESIGN-003, UX-DESIGN-001)

Event architecture is **not applicable in v1**: every public surface is
synchronous request/response, and the usage feed is deliberately **pull-based**
rather than a push channel. Pull over the existing reader contract reuses a
surface that is already built, and with consumer-side deduplication by entry
identifier an overlapping replay is harmless. A push surface would also couple
downstream outages into ingestion. Near-real-time observers poll within
`nfr-query-latency`, subject to the floor and consumer rules in
[§3.10](#310-consistency-contract). The gear emits operational telemetry but
publishes to no business event bus. User experience is not applicable: the gear
exposes REST, SDK, and SPI surfaces only and has no end-user UI.

#### 3.12.4 Versioning and Deprecation Policy (INT-DESIGN-004)

Each public surface versions independently under
`cpt-cf-usage-collector-adr-contract-stability`. The contract starts at the 1.0
release of each surface. From then on, only additive changes ship within a
major, a breaking change needs a new major, and at most one prior major stays
supported. Deprecation flow: mark the element `deprecated` in OpenAPI or Rust
trait docs at least one minor release before the next major, then remove.
Compatibility tests gate every PR per surface.

No surface has reached 1.0 yet. Until each one does, a breaking change ships in
place and that surface's compatibility gate stays off.

## 4. Additional context

The Usage Collector is scoped as a metering substrate. The table below names v1 deferrals. Each one is anchored to a PRD-acknowledged
out-of-scope item and carries a future-additive hook. Later work therefore
fits inside `cpt-cf-usage-collector-adr-contract-stability` without a major-
version bump.

| Topic | v1 stance | Additive hook |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Retention mechanics** | Declared per GTS type, enforced by the plugin. The gear holds the floor as a plugin-readiness condition, not a gear-side sweep. | Plugin-internal — no gear-surface change. |
| **Multi-region deployment** | Not a v1 capability. Cross-region durability, read locality, and conflict resolution are platform-topology concerns. | The stateless, plugin-backed shape layers a multi-region story without contract breaks. |
| **Audit events for operator-write paths** | Not emitted. Gateway-level access logging covers the trail. | Dedicated audit emission added later, additive on SDK and REST. |
| **Push / subscribe surface** | Pull-only by design. Reserved-not-built: a push surface must not couple downstream outages into ingestion, and the pluggable-storage ADR admits backends with no native change feed. | SSE on REST plus a `Stream`-returning SDK method, once a concrete consumer requirement and fan-out design land together. |
| **Bulk and range invalidation** | One entry per invalidation entry. The under-served case — an emitter defect producing many wrong entries — interacts with quotas, recomputation scope, and the feed contract, since a consumer cannot deduplicate a predicate by entry identifier. | A predicate-shaped operation, additive on REST and SDK. |
| **A cumulative fold** | The fold set admits accrued amounts and single observations only. An emitter able to report only a running total must difference its own readings before submission. | Adding a fold is additive. It would require relaxing the prohibition on differentiating and taking on reset detection. |
| **Typed metadata values** | All values are strings on the wire and at rest, irrespective of richer typing the schema can express. | Widening is additive once a consumer needs typed grouping or filtering. |
| **Entry amendment** | Intentionally omitted. The ledger is append-only: the only correction is an appended invalidation, and correcting a quantity is an invalidation followed by a fresh emission under a new key. | Future work refines corrections and consumers, never stored-entry mutation. |

**Open item.** Whether `pep_properties::RESOURCE_ID` binds to a ledger entry's
own `id` or to `resource_ref.resource_id` is not settled (§3.9.6). The two
differ: the first authorizes individual entries, the second authorizes
everything measured about a resource. Settle it before the PEP is written,
because `supported_properties` is a wire-visible contract with the PDP.

## 5. Traceability

- **PRD**: [PRD.md](./PRD.md)
- **Authoritative REST contract**: [usage-collector-v1.yaml](./usage-collector-v1.yaml)
- **GTS base type**: [schemas/usage_record.v1.schema.json](./schemas/usage_record.v1.schema.json)
- **ADRs**: [ADR/](./ADR/) — the ADR inventory in [§1.2](#12-architecture-drivers) indexes all thirteen. Every one is current against this design.
