//! Wire vocabulary of the errors of [`LicenseEnforcementApi`](crate::LicenseEnforcementApi).
//!
//! Every method returns `CanonicalError`. The gear maps its domain errors to it
//! (DESIGN §3.3, Error model). These constants are the stable discriminators
//! that consumers match on:
//!
//! - `InvalidArgument` → `field_violations[].reason` from [`reason`];
//! - `FailedPrecondition` → `violations[].type` is [`PRECONDITION_TYPE`],
//!   `violations[].subject` from [`precondition`];
//! - `Aborted` → `reason` from [`aborted`];
//! - `AlreadyExists` → `resource` is `idempotency_token` for a token reused
//!   with another payload, else the id of a root grant that the evidence names
//!   and the gear already stores;
//! - `Unimplemented` → the linked plugin does not serve the intake that the
//!   operation needs (`issue` or `import`). The binary cannot serve it at all,
//!   so no discriminator is needed.
