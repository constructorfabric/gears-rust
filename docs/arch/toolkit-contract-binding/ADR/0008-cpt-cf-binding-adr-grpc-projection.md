## Context and Problem Statement

ADR-0001 establishes the base trait as the contract's source of truth and REST as
its first projection. DESIGN §7 listed gRPC as an open question with four parts:
proto-first vs. code-first generation, how it interacts with `tonic`, which
streaming shapes to support, and whether a gRPC projection can coexist with a
REST projection on the same base trait.

This ADR is written **after the fact**: `#[toolkit::grpc_contract]` shipped on
`feature/toolkit_contracts` (`grpc_contract.rs`, `proto_bridge.rs`,
`toolkit-contract-protogen`, a committed `proto.lock.toml`, and an integration
test), while PRD §4.2 and DESIGN §7 still described it as future work. Recording
the decisions here closes that gap and gives the shipped behaviour — including
the deliberate asymmetries with REST — a normative home. It was later extended
with the generated consumer path (resolving client, service-name constant,
lazy channel), schema collection for protogen, and the circuit breaker.

## Decision Drivers

* **One base trait, many projections** — a gear that already exposes REST must be
  able to add gRPC without touching its domain contract or its consumers.
* **The `.proto` is a published artifact** — external teams generate clients from
  it, so it must be reviewable in diffs and stable across unrelated refactors,
  not regenerated implicitly at build time.
* **No panic on peer-controlled data** — a malformed field from a remote must not
  take the process down.
* **Server generation is out of scope** (ADR-0002) — service authors write the
  `tonic` server by hand; only the client is generated.

## Considered Options

* **Option A**: Proto-first — hand-author `.proto`, generate the Rust trait from it.
* **Option B**: Code-first with a committed `.proto` — the Rust contract is the
  source of truth; the `.proto` is generated from the contract IR, committed, and
  checked in CI.
* **Option C**: Code-first with no `.proto` artifact — derive `prost` messages
  directly from the DTOs and never materialize a schema file.

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: **Option B — code-first with a committed `.proto`.**

Option A would put the schema and the Rust contract in two places with nothing
reconciling them — the exact drift ADR-0001 exists to prevent. Option C makes the
wire schema invisible: a reviewer cannot see that a field number changed, and
external consumers have nothing to generate against.

### Macro shape

```rust
#[toolkit::grpc_contract(
    package = "api_contracts.payment.v1",
    service = "PaymentApi",
    stubs_module = "crate::grpc::stubs"
)]
pub trait PaymentApiGrpc: PaymentApi {
    #[rpc(name = "Charge")]
    #[idempotency_level(NotIdempotent)]
    async fn charge(&self, ctx: SecurityContext, req: ChargeRequest)
        -> Result<ChargeResponse, CanonicalError>;

    #[rpc(name = "ListPayments")]
    #[idempotency_level(NoSideEffects)]
    #[streaming]
    fn list_payments(&self, ctx: SecurityContext, filter: ListPaymentsFilter)
        -> Result<PaymentSummary, CanonicalError>;
}
```

The macro emits, **all client-side** (the server stays hand-written):

* the cleaned trait and a `<trait>_grpc_binding()` IR function;
* `pub const <BASE>_GRPC_SERVICE: &str = "package.Service"`
  (`PAYMENT_API_GRPC_SERVICE = "api_contracts.payment.v1.PaymentApi"`), the
  name the provider registers the service under and consumers discover it by.
  protogen writes the same `package` and `service` into the `.proto`, so it
  equals tonic's `NamedService::NAME` for the hand-written server;
* `<base>_grpc_schemas<V>(&mut V)`, a visitor over every request and response
  type on the wire, bounded by `V: toolkit_contract::ir::grpc::VisitType<T>`
  per type, so an SDK that never calls it needs no `schemars` (see below);
* a compile-time check,
  `const _: () = toolkit_contract::contract::assert_grpc_package_major::<dyn Base>(package)`:
  a package whose last segment is `v<digits>` must name the major of
  `#[toolkit::contract(version)]`, read through the `ContractVersion` trait
  that `#[toolkit::contract]` now implements; a package without a version
  segment is not checked (`cpt-cf-binding-adr-contract-versioning`);
* gated on `grpc-client`: `{Trait}Client` and `{Trait}ResolvingClient`, each
  with `impl BaseTrait`, so the consumer keeps seeing `Arc<dyn PaymentApi>`.

### `.proto` generation and the lock file

`toolkit-contract-protogen` renders a `.proto` from the contract IR. The result
is **committed**, and `proto.lock.toml` pins it so an unintended schema change
shows up as a lock-file diff rather than silently re-rendering during a build.

The wire-type schemas come from the generated `<base>_grpc_schemas` visitor:
`toolkit_contract_protogen::SchemaCollector` implements `VisitType` for every
`JsonSchema` type and flattens each schema's `$defs`, so nested types are picked
up and an SDK no longer lists its model types by hand. A `ProtoSpec` (contract
IR, binding, schemas, `.proto` path, lockfile path) drives two functions:

* `check_proto(&spec)` — for a test in the SDK (`tests/proto_up_to_date.rs` in
  the `api-contracts` SDK). It fails when the committed `.proto` or lockfile is
  not what the contract generates now, naming the first differing line; with
  `TOOLKIT_PROTO_UPDATE=1` it rewrites both instead.
* `write_proto(&spec)` — what the SDK's `gen_grpc_proto` example calls; `cargo
  xtask proto-regen` runs that example for every SDK that has one.

Regeneration stays an explicit step, and a forgotten one is now a test failure.
There is deliberately no `build.rs` helper: generating at build time would make
the `.proto` an output of the build rather than a reviewed artifact.

### DTO ↔ proto bridging, and the panic rule

`#[derive(ProtoBridge)]` maps a Rust DTO onto its prost stub. Fields that have no
proto primitive (`Uuid`, `Decimal`) are marked `#[proto_bridge(via_string)]` and
cross the wire as strings.

That direction is fallible, and the distinction is load-bearing:

* `From<Proto> for Dto` is **infallible and panics** on an unparseable
  `via_string` field. It is for data this process produced.
* `TryFromProto` / the inherent `try_from_proto` is the fallible counterpart, and
  is **mandatory on every inbound path** — the generated client uses it for
  responses and stream items, and hand-written `tonic` servers must use it for
  requests.

The generated client originally used the panicking conversion on all three
response paths (unary, retryable unary, server-streaming), which made one
malformed field from a peer a remote crash. `TryFromProto` is a trait rather than
just an inherent method so codegen can convert any response type uniformly,
including `ProtoBridge` enums; a hand-written bridge used as a response type gets
a compile error rather than falling back to the panicking path.

Unknown enum discriminants are **not** an error: they log at `warn` and fall back
to `Default`, so a peer adding a variant does not break older clients. Callers
that need to detect it use `try_from_i32`.

### Idempotency and retry

`#[idempotency_level(NoSideEffects | Idempotent | NotIdempotent)]` is emitted into
the `.proto` as the standard `idempotency_level` option. `#[retryable]` on a
`NotIdempotent` method is a **compile error**: the client retries transient
transport failures, and a 502/504 can arrive after the server committed, so the
retry would duplicate the write.

### Streaming scope

**Server-streaming only.** Client-streaming and bidirectional RPCs are not
supported; there is no `Stream`-typed *parameter* form in the projection
vocabulary. A method needing them writes a `tonic` client by hand against the
same base trait.

### Client construction, timeouts and status mapping

`{Trait}Client` has three constructors. `new(channel, config)` wraps a given
channel; `connect(config)` connects eagerly; `connect_lazy(config)` is sync,
touches no network, and returns a client whose channel connects on first use
and reconnects by itself. `connect` and `connect_lazy` configure the endpoint
the same way: a 10 s connect timeout, HTTP/2 keepalive (30 s interval, 10 s
timeout, also while idle), and `config.timeout` as the per-call deadline, sent
as `grpc-timeout` and enforced in the channel. A deadline that fires in the
channel (tonic's `TimeoutExpired`, otherwise `CANCELLED "Timeout expired"`)
maps to `TransportError::Timeout(config.timeout)`, as on the REST path.
`require_tls` refuses a non-`https` endpoint.

Every constructor puts the channel behind the config's circuit breaker
(`toolkit_contract::grpc::GrpcChannel`, built by `guard_channel`); see
`cpt-cf-binding-adr-client-circuit-breaker`. `#[circuit_breaker(skip)]` on a
method lets its requests bypass the breaker.

gRPC `UNIMPLEMENTED` without a Problem trailer maps to canonical
`Unimplemented` ("provider does not implement this RPC; it may run an older
minor version of the contract"), not to an internal error: within one major
version that is what a missing RPC means
(`cpt-cf-binding-adr-contract-versioning`).

### Discovery and generated consumers

`{Trait}ResolvingClient` (`PaymentApiGrpcResolvingClient`) wraps a
`DirectoryResolvingClient`: it carries `const GRPC_SERVICE`, is built with
`new(resolver, from_gear, tuning)`, resolves `GRPC_SERVICE` through the
`EndpointResolver` on every call, and builds a `connect_lazy` client per
endpoint. `#[toolkit::consumes(.., transport = grpc)]` registers it
(`cpt-cf-binding-adr-consumer-wiring`). The provider registers its
hand-written server under `<BASE>_GRPC_SERVICE`
(`RegisterGrpcServiceFn::service_name`), and grpc-hub publishes it in the
directory. The directory resolves by service name across gears; the consumer's
`from` does not filter the lookup (`cpt-cf-adr-instance-addressable-discovery`).

### Coexistence with REST

A base trait may carry both projections. They generate independent clients
(`PaymentApiRestClient`, `PaymentApiGrpcClient`), both implement the base trait,
and `#[toolkit::provides(transports = [local, rest, grpc])]` selects one at
runtime from `clients.provides`. The `api-contracts` example ships all three.

### Known asymmetries with the REST projection

Recorded deliberately rather than left to be rediscovered:

* **No reconnect or idle timeout on gRPC server-streaming.** The REST/SSE path
  reconnects with `Last-Event-ID` and enforces an idle timeout; the gRPC path
  does neither — a dropped stream surfaces as an error to the caller.
* **`SecurityContext` is not compile-time mandatory.** A REST projection method
  without a plane context is rejected at macro-expansion time; a gRPC method is
  not, and simply sends no `authorization` metadata.
* **The policy stack does not run.** As with REST, `policies = [...]` on
  `#[toolkit::provides]` applies to the local transport only; the wiring logs a
  `warn!` when a non-local transport is selected with policies declared.
* **No TLS configuration on the channel.** `require_tls` refuses a non-`https`
  endpoint, but the generated client sets no `ClientTlsConfig`; the REST client
  configures TLS through `toolkit-http`.
* **Errors in trailers after headers are not seen by the circuit breaker.** The
  classifier reads trailers-only responses, which is how tonic servers send
  unary errors; a status that arrives after the response headers (a
  server-streaming error) is not counted.

### Consequences

* The `.proto` and `proto.lock.toml` are review artifacts. A contract change that
  alters the wire schema will not merge without them being regenerated.
* `TryFromProto` is public API. A hand-written proto bridge used as an RPC
  response type must implement it.
* `MAX_PROBLEM_TRAILER_BYTES` bounds the RFC 9457 envelope carried in gRPC
  trailers at 4 KiB of pre-base64 JSON; larger problems are reduced to a minimal
  envelope and flagged with `x-toolkit-problem-truncated`.

### Confirmation

* Integration test: unary, retryable unary, error mapping, and server-streaming
  round-trips against an in-process `tonic` server (`grpc_integration.rs`).
* Hostile-peer test: a server returning malformed `via_string` values on all
  three response paths makes the client return `Err` without panicking
  (`grpc_hostile_peer.rs`).
* Negative compile test: `#[retryable]` on `NotIdempotent`
  (`grpc_retryable_non_idempotent` trybuild fixture).
* `ClientHub` test: a `PaymentApiGrpcClient` resolves as `Arc<dyn PaymentApi>`.
* Drift test: `tests/proto_up_to_date.rs` in the `api-contracts` SDK (`check_proto`).
* Resolving client (`grpc_resolving.rs`): waits for the provider, follows a
  provider that moved, opens and closes its breaker, routes each major to its
  own provider by service name, reports a missing RPC as `Unimplemented`, and
  `PAYMENT_API_GRPC_SERVICE` equals tonic's `NamedService::NAME`.
* Compile-time major check: `assert_grpc_package_major` unit tests in
  `libs/toolkit-contract/src/contract.rs` (`v1` does not match `v10`).

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Option A: Proto-First

* Good, because the wire schema is explicit and idiomatic for gRPC teams.
* Bad, because the Rust contract and the `.proto` become two sources of truth
  with no compiler check between them.
* Bad, because it inverts ADR-0001 for one transport only.

### Option B: Code-First with a Committed `.proto` (chosen)

* Good, because the base trait stays the single source of truth.
* Good, because the schema is a reviewable artifact and external consumers have
  something to generate from.
* Good, because the lock file turns an accidental schema change into a visible
  diff.
* Neutral, because regeneration is a manual step; the SDK's `check_proto` test
  turns a forgotten one into a test failure, and `cargo xtask proto-regen
  --check` checks every SDK at once.

### Option C: Code-First with No `.proto`

* Good, because there is no artifact to keep in sync.
* Bad, because field-number changes become invisible in review — the classic way
  to break every deployed client at once.
* Bad, because external (non-Rust) consumers have nothing to generate against.

## More Information

* ADR-0007 — contract versioning:
  [`0007-cpt-cf-binding-adr-contract-versioning.md`](./0007-cpt-cf-binding-adr-contract-versioning.md)
  — a `V<N>` marker is stripped before the projection-suffix check, so
  `PaymentApiV2Grpc` classifies like `PaymentApiGrpc`.
* `cpt-cf-binding-adr-consumer-wiring` (ADR-0004) — `#[toolkit::consumes(..,
  transport = grpc)]` and readiness by gRPC service name.
* `cpt-cf-binding-adr-client-circuit-breaker` (ADR-0009 in this folder) — the
  breaker around the generated channel.

  `proto_bridge.rs`; proto rendering: `libs/toolkit-contract-protogen`
  (`sync.rs`: `SchemaCollector`, `ProtoSpec`, `check_proto`, `write_proto`).
