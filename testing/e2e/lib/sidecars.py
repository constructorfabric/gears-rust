"""Container sidecars for the E2E orchestrator.

Each class here implements ``lib.orchestrator.SidecarProtocol`` (``name``,
``port``, ``start()``, ``stop()``) so it can be dropped into
``GearTestEnv.sidecars``. The orchestrator starts sidecars before it renders
the config, so ``config_patch`` can read the mapped port.

Deliberately hand-rolled rather than using testcontainers-python: this suite's
requirements.txt is minimal and Snyk-pinned, and testcontainers-rs 0.27 (used
by the Rust plugin tests) ships no ryuk either, so the library would buy no
cleanup guarantee the repo already relies on. Orphans are handled by the label
reaper below.

``_DockerSidecar`` owns the lifecycle every container shares; a subclass
supplies its image, its environment, and its own readiness probe.
