//! What the database said about a refusal, structurally.
//!
//! Three ways to tell why a write was refused existed before this module, and
//! none of them was both complete and stable (issue #4645):
//!
//! * [`sea_orm::DbErr::sql_err`] is typed and portable, but its table is
//!   incomplete — `sea-orm` 2.0 maps `23505` and `23503` for `PostgreSQL` and
//!   has no `Check` discriminant at all, so a `PostgreSQL` 18 `RESTRICT`
//!   refusal (`23001`) returns `None`.
//! * Matching `DbErr`'s message text works until the driver rewords it or the
//!   server is asked to speak another language. `PostgreSQL` 18 did reword the
//!   `RESTRICT` message, which is the kind of change that path cannot survive.
//! * Reading the driver error directly is correct, and used to require a gear
//!   to depend on `sqlx` itself — which the architecture lints forbid, and
//!   which is why the classification ended up copied into gears.
//!
//! This module is the third one, without the dependency: the accessor returns
//! owned strings, so **no `sqlx` type appears in its signature** and a gear
//! that classifies never links the driver.
//!
//! # What belongs here and what does not
//!
//! A SQLSTATE names a *condition*: "a unique constraint was violated". What
//! that condition means for a caller — `409 Conflict`, a domain error, a retry
//! — is the gear's decision (`docs/arch/errors/ADR/0004`, which delegates
//! fine-grained mapping to gears). So this module classifies conditions and
//! stops there.
//!
//! Which leaves the question of where the line falls, since naming the five
//! conditions below is itself a choice. The test is **whether a caller in this
//! workspace branches on the distinction**:
//!
//! * A code earns a variant when some caller already acts differently on it.
//!   [`ConstraintViolation`] is `#[non_exhaustive]` so that a sixth one can be
//!   added the day a caller needs it, rather than in advance.
//! * Two codes collapse into one variant when no caller would branch between
//!   them. `23503` and `23001` differ in *when* the foreign key was checked,
//!   not in what the caller must now do: rows still reference this one.
//! * A distinction nobody branches on is not discarded, only left unnamed —
//!   [`DriverRefusal::code`] still returns the code verbatim, so a caller that
//!   does need to tell immediate `RESTRICT` from deferrable `NO ACTION` can,
//!   without this module having to guess on its behalf.

///   Retry decisions belong to [`crate::contention`], not here;
/// * this crate was built with no database driver, which also means nothing
///   could have produced a driver error;
/// * the driver reported a refusal but gave no code at all. `sqlx` allows it
///   in principle, and then this is indistinguishable from the cases above.

///   always send a SQLSTATE, `SQLite` always an extended result code — so the
///   code stays a `String` rather than costing every caller an extra `Option`
///   for a state none of them can observe.
///
