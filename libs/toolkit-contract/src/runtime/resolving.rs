//! Directory-resolving REST transport.
//!
//! [`DirectoryResolvingClient`] is a thin, self-healing wrapper around a
//! generated `<Trait>RestClient`. Instead of binding to a single static base
//! URL at construction time, it resolves the provider's endpoint from the
//! service directory on every call and rebuilds the underlying client only
//! when the resolved endpoint changes.
//!
//! This is what makes the consumer side tolerant of *eventual readiness* and
//! runtime churn:
//! - **Not ready yet** — the provider hasn't registered → resolution yields
//!   `None` → calls fail with [`TransportError::Unresolved`] (a transient
//!   error that maps to `service_unavailable`), never a panic.
//! - **Provider moved / pod replaced** — the directory returns a new endpoint
//!   → the wrapper rebuilds the client against it on the next call.
//! - **Provider vanished** — all instances evicted → resolution yields `None`
//!   again → `Unresolved`; the wrapper recovers automatically once a live
//!   instance reappears.
//!
//! The `Arc<dyn Trait>` registered in the `ClientHub` is the long-lived
//! resolving wrapper, so the hub entry is wired once and never replaced; all
//! churn handling lives inside this transport.
